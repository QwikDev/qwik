The optimizer plugin will now rely on Rollup to group QRL segments. It will only provide hints on which segments fit well together. The result of this change is that now code splitting happens during the transform phase only, and other Rollup/Vite plugins (such as css-in-js plugins) can transform the code before Qwik transforms it.
