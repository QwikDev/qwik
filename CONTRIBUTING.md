# Contributing to Qwik

Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to Qwik! We appreciate you! 🫶🏽

Below are the guidelines on how to help in the best possible way.

## Submitting an Issue

Before creating a new issue, please search through open issues using the [GitHub issue search bar](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests). You might find the solution to your problem, or can verify that it is an already known issue.

We want a bug-free and best-performing project. That's why we take all reported issues to heart. But please be aware that if we can't reproduce the problem, we won't have a way of locating and adequately fixing it.

Therefore, to solve the problem in the best possible way, please create a minimal repository that reproduces the problem with the least possible code explaining and demonstrating the error.

Without enough information to reproduce the issue, we will close it because we can't recreate and solve it.

## Triaging Issues

If you're interested in helping out with triaging issues, please follow the [Triaging Guide](./contributing/TRIAGE.md).

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

### Branch Organization

We adopt [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) therefore all Pull Requests are made against the main branch because we do not use separate branches for development or for the versions we release.

### Good first issue

The issues marked with [_Good first issue_](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22COMMUNITY%3A++good+first+issue%22) are a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the project.

Before solving the problem, please check with the maintainers that the issue is still relevant. Feel free to leave a comment on the issue to show your intention to work on it and prevent other people from unintentionally duplicating your effort.

### Sending a Pull Request

Before submitting a pull request, consider the following guidelines:

- Fork the repository into your own account.
- In your forked repository, create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch main`
- Make your changes/fixes.
- Run `pnpm fmt` to lint the code.
- Commit your code with a good commit message [using "Commitizen"](#committing-using-commitizen).
- Push your branch to GitHub: `git push origin my-branch`
- In GitHub, send a pull request to `QwikDev:main`.

> If you aren't sure your PR is ready, open it as a [draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to make it clear to the maintainer.

### ⚠ Troubleshooting PR build issues on CI

Every PR is being automatically merged with `main` before the CI Github actions run.
That's why if the CI checks aren't passing your PR branch is probably not up to date.

**For non documentation PRs please do the following:**

1. Merge `main` into your PR branch
2. Run `pnpm api.update`
3. Run `pnpm build.local` or `pnpm build.full` if you made a change to the Rust code
4. Commit and push any changes as a result of the above steps

## Local development

This is the best approach because all required dependencies will be installed in the docker container for you and won't affect your personal configuration in any way.

### Prerequisites

You need to have these tools up and running in your local machine:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

and either [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Nix](https://nixos.org).

### Steps

If you want to use Docker:

- Install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in your VSCode.
- Once installed you will be prompted to 'Reopen the folder to develop in a container [learn more](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) or Clone repository in Docker volume for [better I/O performance](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume)'. If you're not prompted, you can run the `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container` command from the [VSCode Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

Alternatively you can use [devcontainers/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli):

- Install devcontainers following their documentation.
- In your terminal navigate to the Qwik's project root directory.
- Then run `devcontainer up --workspace-folder .`. This command will start a Docker container with all required environment dependencies.

If you want to use Nix:

- Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) on your machine and enable flakes. The [DetSys installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) makes that easy.
- run `nix develop` in the project root.

Nix+Direnv (optional):

You can additionally use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to automatically load the dev environment when you enter the project directory.

### Using development container without Dev Containers and VSCode

If you would like to make use of the development container solution, but don't use VSCode or Dev Containers, you still can do so, by following steps:

- Build development container locally: `cd .devcontainer; docker build -t qwik-container .`
- Run development container from Qwik project root, binding the directory to container: `cd ..; docker run --rm -d --name qwik-container -p 3300:3300 -p 9229:9299 -v $PWD:/home/circleci/project -t qwik-container`

Docker command does:

- Create a new container that is removed once stopped,
- In daemon mode,
- With name `qwik-container`,
- That exposes the ports `3300` and `9229`, and
- Binds `qwik` project directory to container working directory.

### Podman extras

> This section is highly influenced by SO answer: https://serverfault.com/a/1075838/352338
> If you use [Podman](https://podman.io/) instead of Docker as your containers engine, then you need to know the following:

- Container runs as user `circleci` with UID `1001` and GID `1002`.
- As you are accustomed to using Podman, you will need to append `:Z` to `volumes | -v` parameter so the command becomes:

```bash
$ subuid_size=65536
$ subgid_size=65536
$ container_uid=1001
$ container_gid=1002
$ podman run --rm \
    --user $container_uid:$container_gid \
    --uidmap=0:1:$container_uid \
    --uidmap=$((container_uid + 1)):$((container_uid + 1)):$((subuid_size - $container_uid)) \
    --uidmap=$container_uid:0:1 \
    --gidmap=0:1:$container_gid \
    --gidmap=$((container_gid + 1)):$((container_gid + 1)):$((subgid_size - $container_gid)) \
    --gidmap=$container_gid:0:1 \
    -d --name qwik-container \
    -p 3300:3300 -p 9229:9299 \
    -v .:/home/circleci/project:Z \
    -t qwik-container
```

## Alternative way

If you're not able to use the dev container, follow these instructions:

### Installation

> These are for a full build that includes Rust binaries.

1. Make sure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is installed.
2. Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) with `cargo install wasm-pack` .
3. Node version >= `18`.
4. Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.
5. run `pnpm install`

> On Windows, Rust requires [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). You can also select _Desktop development with C++_
> while installing Visual Studio.

> Alternatively, if Rust is not available you can run `pnpm build.platform.copy` to download bindings from CDN

## Development

To build Qwik for local development, install the dev dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and then do an initial build:

```shell
pnpm install && pnpm build.local
```

### Fast build

It will build only Qwik and Qwik City.

```shell
pnpm build.core
```

### Custom build

E.g. to build only the react integration:

```shell
pnpm build --qwikreact
```

Run without arguments for all supported flags. Notable:

- `--tsm`: typecheck
- `--build`: Qwik (you'll probably also need `--api`)
- `--qwikcity`: Qwik City (you'll probably also need `--api`)
- `--qwikreact`: Qwik React
- `--qwiklabs`: Qwik React
- `--eslint`: Eslint plugin

### Full build without Rust

It will build everything except Rust prerequisites and the optimizer binaries.

```shell
pnpm build.local
```

### Full build

It will build **everything**, including Rust packages and WASM.

> First build might be very slow.

- Builds each submodule
- Generates bundled `.d.ts` files for each submodule with [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/)
- Checks the public API hasn't changed
- Builds a minified `core.min.mjs` file
- Generates the publishing `package.json`

```shell
pnpm build.full
```

The build output will be written to `packages/qwik/dist`, which will be the directory that is published to [@builder.io/qwik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@builder.io/qwik).

### Run in your own app:

Say you made changes to the repo. After you finished you'd need to run the build command (`pnpm build.full`/`pnpm build`).

To use your build in your project, follow these steps:

1. Inside the root of the `qwik` project run:

   ```shell
   pnpm link.dist
   ```

   or

   ```shell
   pnpm link.dist.npm
   ```

   or

   ```shell
   pnpm link.dist.yarn
   ```

2. Inside the root of your project run:

   ```shell
    pnpm install
    pnpm link --global @builder.io/qwik @builder.io/qwik-city
   ```

   or

   ```shell
   npm install
   npm link @builder.io/qwik @builder.io/qwik-city
   ```

   or

   ```shell
    yarn install
    yarn link @builder.io/qwik @builder.io/qwik-city
   ```

If you can't use package linking (npm link) just copy the contents of `packages/qwik/dist` into your projects' `node_modules/@builder.io/qwik` folder, and/or the contents of `packages/qwik-city/lib` into your projects' `node_modules/@builder.io/qwik-city` folder.

### Test against the docs site:

1. At the root of the Qwik repo folder run:

```shell
pnpm install
```

2. Run the docs site:

```shell
pnpm docs.dev
```

### To open the test apps for debugging run:

```shell
pnpm serve
```

### Unit Tests Only

Unit tests use [vitest](https://vitest.dev)

```shell
pnpm test.unit
```

### E2E Tests Only

E2E tests use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

To run the Playwright tests headless, from start to finish, run:

```shell
pnpm test.e2e.chromium
```

Finally, you can use `pnpm --filter` command to run packages' commands, for example:

```shell
pnpm --filter qwik-docs start
```

More commands can be found in each package's package.json scripts section.

### Updating dependencies

To update all dependencies, run:

```shell
pnpm deps
```

This will show an interactive UI to update all dependencies. Be careful about performing major updates, especially for the docs site, since not all functionality has test coverage there.

### Committing using "Commitizen":

Instead of using `git commit` please use the following command:

```shell
pnpm commit
```

You'll be asked guiding questions which will eventually create a descriptive commit message and necessary to generate meaningful release notes / CHANGELOG automatically.

### Pre-submit hooks

The project has pre-submit hooks, which ensure that your code is correctly formatted. You can run them manually like so:

```shell
pnpm lint
```

Some issues can be fixed automatically by using:

```shell
pnpm fmt
```

## Releasing (core-team)

1. Run `pnpm release.prepare`, which will test, lint and build.
2. Use the interactive UI to select the next version, which will update the `package.json` `version` property, add the git change, and start a commit message.
3. Create a PR with the `package.json` change to merge to `main`.
4. After the `package.json` with the updated version is in `main`, click the [Run Workflow](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/actions/workflows/ci.yml) button from the "Qwik CI" GitHub Action workflow.
5. Select the NPM dist-tag that should be used for this version, then click "Run Workflow".
6. The GitHub Action will dispatch the workflow to build `@builder.io/qwik`, `@builder.io/qwik-city` and each of their submodules, build WASM and native bindings, and validate the package before publishing to NPM.
7. If the build is successful and all tests and validation passes, the workflow will automatically publish to NPM, commit a git tag to the repo, and create a GitHub release.
8. ⚡️
