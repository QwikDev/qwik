# The HTML-first framework

Qwik is designed for the fastest possible page load time, by delivering pure HTML with near 0 javascript for your pages to become interactive, regardless of how complex your site or app is. It achieves this via [resumability](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/main/packages/docs/pages/docs/concepts/resumable.mdx) of HTML and [ultra fine-grained lazy-loading](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/main/packages/docs/pages/docs/concepts/progressive.mdx) of code.

## Getting Started

Try out our starter:

```bash
npm init qwik@latest
```

- Understand the difference between [resumable and replayable](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/main/packages/docs/pages/docs/concepts/resumable.mdx) applications.
- Learn about Qwik's high level [mental model](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/main/packages/docs/pages/docs/think-qwik.mdx).
