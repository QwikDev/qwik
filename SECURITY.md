# Reporting Security Issues

The Qwik team and community are dedicated to keeping our project secure, and we appreciate your help in identifying and disclosing security issues responsibly. Your efforts make a big difference!

To report a security issue, please use the "[Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/security/advisories/new)" tab on our GitHub Security Advisory page.

After you submit a report, we'll get back to you with the next steps. We'll keep you updated on our progress towards fixing the issue and any related announcements. If we need more information, we might reach out to you for further details.

For security issues in third-party modules, please contact the maintainer of the module directly. Alternatively, you can use the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) and select "I'm reporting a security vulnerability."

Thanks for helping us keep Qwik safe and secure!
