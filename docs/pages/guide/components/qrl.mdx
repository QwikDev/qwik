# QRL

QRL is Qwik-URL. It is a URL which contains custom protocols which is understood by Qwik. All QRLs are syntactically valid URLs, however QRLs have custom protocols and so can't be used directly by the browser.

## Protocol

Javascript supports importing code through the `import('./some_path')` function. The `import` function performs the `./some_path` import relative to the file where the `import()` function was invoked. Normally this works great. The problem is that if the `import()` is in the framework code then all relative paths need to be relative to the framework.

The relative nature of the `import()` statement is problematic when composing applications.

Assume this HTML:

```html
<button on:click="./handle_click"></button>
```

1. First the QRLs are often embedded in HTML. In such a case the relative nature should be from the HTML not from the framework. However the HTML URL often has a custom URL due to routing, and so really the URL has nothing to do with where the code actually resides.
2. To compose libraries, the library author does not know how the files will be laid out (or bundled) on the application server. So there needs to be a way to refer to resources but give the configuration to the application developer.

For the above two reasons relative imports just don't make much sense in Qwik and should be avoided. Instead we need to use absolute URLs. However sprinkling absolute URLs all over the code base is equally problematic as it makes the code hard to refactor or move.

```html
<button on:click="http://myserver.com/app/handle_click"></button>
```

Protocols solve this problem. Protocols allow the developer to express an absolute URL in a configurable format.

```html
<button on:click="myApp:/handle_click"></button>
```

The above says that the `/handle_click` can be found relative to `myApp:`. This requires that application developer can configure `myApp:`. The configuration needs to be done on the server as well as on the browser.

### Browser protocol configuration

```html
<script>
  let Q = {
    protocol: {
      myApp: 'http://myserver.com/app',
    },
  };
</script>
```

The above global configuration simply says that `myApp:/handle_click` should be translated to `http://myserver.com/app/handle_click`. Notice that all that is needed to configure the protocol is the declaration of the `Q` property on a global namespace such as `window`.

## File extension

When Qwik imports a QRL it always imports it with a `.js` extension.
