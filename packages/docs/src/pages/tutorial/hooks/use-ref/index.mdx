Use `useRef()` to get a hold of DOM elements created by the component.

There are two parts to retrieving a DOM element reference:
1. `useRef()` returns a `ref` object that contains a `current` property which will eventually contain the reference. 
2. `ref={_ref_variable_}` is a prop binding that will set the `current` property of the `ref` object to the DOM element.

## Example

The example on the right uses `useRef()` to get a reference to the `input` element. However, it is missing the `ref` prop binding. Add the `ref` prop binding to make the example work as expected
