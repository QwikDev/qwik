Use `useWatch$()` to execute a function before the initial render and whenever the tracking values change. The function executes before rendering, but it can't delay rendering, so if `useWatch$()` is asynchronous, the rendering will happen before the `useWatch$()` is fully executed. If you need to delay rendering, see [`useWaitOn()`](/tutorial/hooks/use-wait-on).

## Tracking store changes

The `useWatch$()` hook receives a `track()` function used for setting up subscriptions that will automatically rerun the `useWatch$()` hook. The set of `track()` properties resets on each `useWatch$()` execution, therefore it is important to always use `track()` to set up subscriptions anew. Because of this it is possible for the `useWatch$()` to subscribe to different properties over time.

## Cleanup

The `useWatch$()` hook can return a cleanup callback. This is useful for cleaning up any resources before new execution.
