Welcome to the Qwik tutorial. This is a series of short tutorials that will help you get started with Qwik. The introduction is a set of problems that will teach you how to create a component, store data, attach listeners, and fetch data from the server. So let's get started.

## Creating a component

Use the editor on the right to create a UI that looks something like this:

```
GitHub organization: __________
- Qwik
- Partytown
```

The HTML code for this component should be this:
```HTML
<div>
  <span>
    GitHub organization:
    <input value="BuilderIO" />
  </span>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik">Qwik</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown">Partytown</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

You can click the "Show Me" button in the bottom left to see the completed solution.
