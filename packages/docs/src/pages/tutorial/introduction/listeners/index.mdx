title: Qwik Tutorial - Listeners

In this tutorial, we will add an event listener to the input. We will use the `keyup` event to listen to changes on the input. The goal is to update the `org` as the user types.

Use the `onKeyUp$` property on the `<input>` element to add an event listener.

Notice that the assignment to the store (`github.org = ...`) automatically triggers the component re-rendering.
