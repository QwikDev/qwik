## Zero-runtime CSS solution

Zero-runtime CSS solution for Google Fonts, Bunny Fonts, and more. Reduce CLS and boost performance.<br/>
Some time ago, we came across an impressive library called [Fontaine](https://github.com/unjs/fontaine), created and maintained by the talented [Daniel Roe](https://github.com/danielroe).

The idea behind the library is to optimize the way [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) developers use fonts by providing a similar native font while the font files are being downloaded, 
so when the switch to the actual font happens - the ‚Äúglitch‚Äù will be minimal, and by that reducing the bad CLS score on google core web vitals.

Out of curiosity, we attempted to integrate it into a Qwik project and noticed there could be an opportunity to make it framework agnostic.

> After diving into the source code, we figured out pretty quickly that the core of the library is generic enough and can be adopted by all the frameworks powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

Motivated by this idea, we decided to join forces - the Nuxt and Qwik teams and to create an open-source library as a Vite plugin that will benefit all frameworks.

Daniel Roe was super generous to provide the product of his hard work and to extract it into a generic mutual core and we had a wonderful time  collaborating  with him for the good of the JavaScript community.

After a few weeks of hard work, [Damian Pumar](https://github.com/damianpumar) had the solution up and running in his local machine.<br/> 
It was incredible to see how smooth the integration is with pretty much all the frameworks.<br/>

We'd like to thank Daniel Roe, the Nuxt team and the [unjs](https://unjs.io/) project for helping us make this vision of making this brilliant work of Daniel on font optimization available for all frameworks.

This is a great example of how the shared vision of ‚Äúautomatic optimization‚Äù for the web comes into fruition.

Automatic font optimization? Yes, please! Say goodbye to CLS issues with Fontless. [Install it now](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fontless)!
