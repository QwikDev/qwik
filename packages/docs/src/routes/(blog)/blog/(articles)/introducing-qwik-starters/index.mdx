Nothing is more satisfying than playing with code and discovering new things! Yes, it is finally here, `npm init qwik` for you to try and discover a different way to build web apps that stay lean and performant no matter their size. It is the same technology that is powering [builder.io](https://www.builder.io) and gets [100/100 PageSpeed](https://www.builder.io/blog/how-we-cut-99-percent-js-with-qwik-and-partytown).

Qwik starter CLI is a simple starter for you to try experimenting with Qwik first hand and to get a better understanding of just how different it is.

The CLI consist of these four examples, that will be expanded in the near future:

1.  `starter`: A basic hello world.
2.  `starter-builder`: A basic hello world integrated with Builder's [Qwik API](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/qwik-api).
3.  `starter-partytown`: A basic hello world showing how expensive tasks can be run on web-worker with [Partytown](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown)
4.  `todo`: A classic [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) application.
