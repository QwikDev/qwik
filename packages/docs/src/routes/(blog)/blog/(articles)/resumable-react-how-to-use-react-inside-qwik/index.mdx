Did you know you can leverage almost the entirety of the React ecosystem inside a Qwik application?

Basically, you can build React applications, without ever loading React in the user's browser. Sounds good, doesn't it? Let’s see how this works.

> You can download the code in this blog post on [GitHub](https://github.com/BuilderIO/resumable-react-post).

## Kicking off

First, we need a new Qwik app. To create and bootstrap an app, we can run this command — I chose [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) as my package manager, but you can do the same command with `npm`:

```
pnpm create qwik@latest
```

Follow the CLI (command line interface) prompts. When you finish, it should look something like this:

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Fbf6f21f590f145c3b7427ab8ead72507?format=webp&width=800" alt="a screenshot showing the CLI output of creating a new Qwik app." />

## Installing `qwik-react`

Next, we need to add [`qwik-react`](https://qwik.dev/integrations/integration/react/) so we can wrap our React components with the `qwikify$()` method:

```bash
pnpm run qwik add react
```

This will once again give us a CLI output that looks like this:

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Ffb3bde63f5744eb0bd4c539433c892d8?width=800" alt="a screenshot showing the CLI output of running pnpm run qwik add react." />

The above image shows that this has installed:

- `@builder.io/qwik-react 0.2.1`
- `@emotion/react 11.10.4`
- `@emotion/styled 11.10.4`
- `@mui/material 5.10.10`
- `@mui/x-data-grid 5.17.8`
- `@types/react 18.0.14`
- `@types/react-dom 18.0.5`
- `react 18.2.0`
- `react-dom 18.2.0`

Most of these packages help showcase [Material UI](https://mui.com/) working within Qwik, which needs `emotion` as a dependency. The real substance is in `qwik-react` and the `react` and `react-dom` dependencies.

## Initial demo

Let’s run our app in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Now, if we go to [`http://localhost:5173/`](http://localhost:5173/) the initial page renders:

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F4de09e8f126e447c96543d3e6688a331?width=800" alt="A screenshot of a newly created Qwik app." />

For the generated UI, we can go to [`http://localhost:5173/react`](http://localhost:5173/react) to display some React Material UI components inside our Qwik app:

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F589ecbdb31484def8d65e8b41318ce3f?width=800" alt="A screenshot of a qwik app using React MaterialUI components." />

And if we interact with the components, they all work:

</video>

## A look under the hood

Let’s open up `src/integrations/react` and check out what the CLI generated:

```tsx
/** @jsxImportSource react */

import { qwikify$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-react';
import { Button, Slider } from '@mui/material';
import { DataGrid, GridColDef, GridValueGetterParams } from '@mui/x-data-grid';

export const MUIButton = qwikify$(Button);
export const MUISlider = qwikify$(Slider, { eagerness: 'hover' });

export const TableApp = qwikify$(() => {
  const columns: GridColDef[] = [
    { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID', width: 70 },
    { field: 'firstName', headerName: 'First name', width: 130 },
    { field: 'lastName', headerName: 'Last name', width: 130 },
    {
      field: 'age',
      headerName: 'Age',
      type: 'number',
      width: 90,
    },
    {
      field: 'fullName',
      headerName: 'Full name',
      description: 'This column has a value getter and is not sortable.',
      sortable: false,
      width: 160,
      valueGetter: (params: GridValueGetterParams) =>
        `${params.row.firstName || ''} ${params.row.lastName || ''}`,
    },
  ];

  const rows = [
    { id: 1, lastName: 'Snow', firstName: 'Jon', age: 35 },
    // more rows with same object shape ,removed for brevity.
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello from React</h1>

      <div style={{ height: 400, width: '100%' }}>
        <DataGrid
          rows={rows}
          columns={columns}
          pageSize={5}
          rowsPerPageOptions={[5]}
          checkboxSelection
          disableSelectionOnClick
        />
      </div>
    </>
  );
});
```

There are a few things to notice here.

The first is `/** @jsxImportSource react */` at the top of the file; this instructs the Qwik compiler to use React to produce the JSX.

The second thing is how React components are _qwikified:_

```typescript
import { qwikify$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-react';
import { Button, Slider } from '@mui/material';

export const MUIButton = qwikify$(Button);
export const MUISlider = qwikify$(Slider, { eagerness: 'hover' });
```

The `MUIButton` is declared as a wrapper for `Button` from inside the `@mui/material` package and is exported and ready to use within a Qwik app.

It is important to note that a component wrapped this way is not interactive by default and renders only the markup.

## Adding interactivity

`MUISlider` has a second argument passed with the `{ eagerness: 'hover'}` option.

This is how we trigger the React hydration step, which makes the component interactive.

There are several ways we can define when hydration is triggered.

### With the second argument for `qwikify$`

> The `QwikifyOptions` are undocumented at the moment of writing, as Qwik is still in beta and the docs are still being worked on. You can find the definitions [inside the source code](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/blob/HEAD/packages/qwik-react/src/react/types.ts).

For the `eagerness` property we can pass in one of the following options:

- `load`: triggered once the document loads. Good for UI elements that need to be as interactive as soon as possible.
- `visible`: hydrate once the component is in the viewport. Good for low-priority UI elements that might be further down the page; that is, below the fold.
- `idle`: the component hydrates when the browser becomes idle after every important task has been completed.
- `hover`: trigger hydration when the mouse hovers over the element.

### Client strategies (directives)

Similar to [Astro’s client directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives), Qwik has the `client:` JSX property. They are the same as the aforementioned strategies but you can put them on the component’s markup:

```tsx
export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <MUISlider client:load></MUISlider>
      <MUISlider client:visible></MUISlider>
      <MUISlider client:idle></MUISlider>
      <MUISlider client:hover></MUISlider>
    </>
  );
});
```

However, there are three more strategies:

- `client:signal`
- `client:event`
- `client-only`

Let's look at each.

`client:signal`, based on Qwik’s reactive hook `useSignal()`, allows hydration whenever a signal’s value becomes `true`:

```tsx
export default component$(() => {
  const shouldHydrate = useSignal(false);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick$={() => (shouldHydrate.value = true)}>Hydrate Slider when click</button>

      <MUISlider client:signal={shouldHydrate}></MUISlider>
    </>
  );
});
```

`client:event` triggers when specific DOM events are dispatched:

```tsx
export default component$(() => {
	const count = useSignal(0);
  return (
    <>
      <p>This slider will only run hydration after a click on it</p>
      <MUIEventSlider
        client:event="click"
        value={count.value}
        onChange$={(_, value) => {
          count.value = value as number;
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
});
```

`client:only`: will not run server-side render, only on the browser.

## Loading React without React runtime

Now that we know the options, let’s see how we can load a React component without actually loading the code.

For this, we’ll create a new route in our application and add the `MUIButton` component:

```tsx
// src/routes/no-react/index.tsx

import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { MUIButton } from '~/integrations/react/mui';

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>React component with no React code</h2>
      <MUIButton variant="contained">I'm a button from react</MUIButton>
    </div>
  );
});
```

If we now navigate to our newly created route we can see that everything renders correctly:

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F2dc7a88861ec411c9e23058398e5794c?width=800" alt="a screenshot of a React component with no React code inside a Qwik app." />

### Adding interactivity via Qwik

What we’ve done in the above example is nice, but we would like the button to actually do something. We want an event listener but without React’s [synthetic events](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react-dom/components/common#react-event-object).

At first, I thought that this would work:

```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { MUIButton } from '~/integrations/react/mui';

export default component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>React component with Qwik sigal</h2> // ❌
      <MUIButton
        variant="contained"
        onClick$={() => {
          count.value++;
        }}
      >
        I'm a button from react
      </MUIButton>
      <p>current count is: {count.value}</p>
    </div>
  );
});
```

My reasoning behind this was that using `useSignal()` would give me the reactivity I needed, and then an `onClick$` on the `MUIButton` would be enough.

However, there’s a good reason this doesn’t work, as [Manu](https://twitter.com/manucorporat) (Qwik core maintainer) explained to me:

> Passing an `onClick` this way will pass down the callback method into React, and then it’s up to it to execute it (with its synthetic event system).

It’s not actually a DOM event listener as I thought it would be.

So, to get this to work we could add one of the client directives, like `client:visble`. Then we’d have:

```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { MUIButton } from '~/integrations/react/mui';

export default component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Visibly hydrated React component</h2>
      <MUIButton
        client:visible
        variant="contained"
        onClick$={() => {
          count.value++;
        }}
      >
        I'm a button from react
      </MUIButton>
      <p>current count is: {count.value}</p>
    </div>
  );
});
```

This works. However, notice from the video below, React is loaded, as my React DevTools on the right show:

<video muted loop autoplay>
  <source src="https://cdn.builder.io/o/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Fabac48a50e7f43b198129c1a8429d46b%2Fcompressed?apiKey=YJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt&token=abac48a50e7f43b198129c1a8429d46b&alt=media&optimized=true" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

In order to get the result we want, we need to use the `host:` attribute, which allows us to [listen to DOM events without hydration](https://qwik.dev/integrations/integration/react/#listen-to-dom-events-without-hydration).

Let’s refactor a bit and see what this looks like:

```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { MUIButton } from '~/integrations/react/mui';

export default component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>React component with no React code</h2>
      <MUIButton
        // we removed the hydration directive
        variant="contained"
        // and just added "host:" in front of our onClick$
        host:onClick$={() => {
          count.value++;
        }}
      >
        I'm a button from react
      </MUIButton>
      <p>current count is: {count.value}</p>
    </div>
  );
});
```

Now it works without React! 🎉🎉🎉

We can infer this since our dev tools are not showing the React DevTools extension as they did before:

<video muted loop autoplay>
  <source src="https://cdn.builder.io/o/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F106b0b982c5d4a34b7bef04cc48ec4de%2Fcompressed?apiKey=YJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt&token=106b0b982c5d4a34b7bef04cc48ec4de&alt=media&optimized=true" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

One last thing to notice is that now we do not get that nice Material UI ripple effect because it needs to be triggered internally by React code.

But we did get a React component that is pure HTML with reactivity from Qwik signals, which is way less code.

</video>

## Less code

Time to look at some numbers. When I say less code, what do I mean? (This is after building and running locally on my very fast machine.)

Qwikified React component with hydration with signal: **95.6KB** of JS over the network.

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F008d6cf4e746417aad0d5eab7b837d34?width=800" alt="A screenshot of a Qwik app with a hydrated React component and the devtools network pane on the right side." />

For fun, I built the same minimal example with a brand new `vite` / `React` project and installed the same React dependencies.

This is the React app code:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

import './App.css';
import { Button } from '@mui/material';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div>
        <h2>Regular React component</h2>
        <Button
          variant="contained"
          onClick={() => {
            setCount(count + 1);
          }}
        >
          I'm a button from react
        </Button>
        <p>current count is: {count}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

React Vite build is less JS over the network: **71.9KB** of JS in one single file.

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F55660795b82143539e59911095105600?width=800" alt="A screenshot of a React app with the devtools network pane on the right side." />

However, it seems that the React app has twice as much time-to-interactive than Qwik running React (on my machine, running lighthouse with a new Arc browser space with no extensions).

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F6b5c75a6e1254e78a58602329f4c8532?width=800" alt="screenshot showing a lighthouse score of 0.6s for Qwik app." />

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F9e53f1e6ed8245e8b81e0c3f4da2e02b?width=800" alt="screenshot showing a lighthouse score of 1.2s for React app." />

Qwikified React component with no react code: **7.7KB**

<img class="w-full" src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F239064e3579a4f1b8c6be4dad8cf8c05?width=800" alt="A screenshot of a Qwik app with the devtools network pane on the right that shows only 7.7KB transfer over the network." />

## Things to look out for

At the time of this writing, Qwik is still in beta. So, as APIs are still changing and docs are still being polished there is still some work to be done.

Some things to keep in mind:

- Every Qwikified React component is isolated — it’s a fully isolated app. It's an island similar to [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/). However, here they hydrate independently.
- Things can get duplicated, like styles.
- You cannot inherit React context
- Interactivity is disabled by default.

Known issues:

- When playing around with new routes that use `qwik-react`, you need to restart the server.

## Conclusion

In this post:

- We went over how to load React code inside of a Qwik application.
- We learned how to make it interactive via the different hydration strategies available.
- We learned how to make React resumable by loading the React component as HTML and allowing Qwik to handle interactions.

Having the option not to duplicate what you might have done in the past and have the ability to port it to a different foundation is exciting.

I see how this method could be leveraged to migrate React SPAs to Instant Reactive Qwik apps in the future.
