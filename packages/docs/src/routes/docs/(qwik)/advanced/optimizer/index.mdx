# Optimizer

Qwik's philosophy is to delay loading code for as long as possible. To do that, Qwik relies on an Optimizer to re-arrange the code for lazy loading. The Optimizer is a code level transformation that runs as part of the rollup.

> The Optimizer is written in Rust (and available as WASM) for instant performance.

The Optimizer looks for `$` and applies a transformation that extracts the expression following the `$` and turns it into a lazy-loadable and importable symbol.

Let's start by looking at a simple `Counter` example:

```tsx
export const Counter = component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);

  return <button onClick$={() => count.value++}>{count.value}</button>;
});
```

The above code represents what a developer would write to describe the component. Below are the transformations that the Optimizer applies to the code to make the code lazy-loadable.

```tsx
const Counter = component(qrl('./chunk-a.js', 'Counter_onMount'));
```

```tsx title="chunk-a.js"
export const Counter_onMount = () => {
  const count = useSignal(0);
  return <button onClick$={qrl('./chunk-b.js', 'Counter_onClick', [count])}>{count.value}</button>;
};
```

```tsx title="chunk-b.js"
const Counter_onClick = () => {
  const [count] = useLexicalScope();
  return count.value++;
};
```

Notice that every occurrence of `$` results in a new lazy loadable symbol.

## Serialization

See [serialization](../../concepts/resumable/index.mdx#serialization) for a discussion of what is serializable.
