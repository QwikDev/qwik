# Components

Components are the basic building blocks of Qwik Applications. They are reusable piece of code that can be used to build a UI.

Qwik components are unique in that:

- Qwik components automatically get broken down into lazy-loaded chunks by the [Optimizer](../../advanced/optimizer/index.mdx).
- They are [resumable](../../concepts/resumable/index.mdx) (a component can get created on a server and continue its execution on the client).
- They are [reactive](../../concepts/reactivity/index.mdx) and render independently of other components on the page. See [rendering](../../components/rendering/index.mdx).

## `component$()`

A Qwik component is a function that returns JSX wrapped in a `component$` call.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/component/simple/index.tsx" style={{ height: '3em' }}>
```tsx /component$/
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  return <div>Hello World!</div>;
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

> The reason for the `component$` is that the trailing `$` allows the [Optimizer](/docs/advanced/dollar/) to break the components into an application tree into a separate chunk so that each chunk can be loaded (or not loaded if it is not needed) independently. Without the `$` the component would be always loaded if the parent component needs to be loaded.

### Composing Components

Components can be composed together to create more complex components.


<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/component/child/index.tsx" style={{ height: '6em' }}>
```tsx {7}
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Parent Text</p>
      <Child />
    </>
  );
});

const Child = component$(() => {
  return <p>Child Text</p>;
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

> Notice that Qwik components are already lazy loaded thanks to the `$` sign. That means that you don't need to dynamically import the child component manually, Qwik will do it for you.

### Counter Example

A slightly more complex example of a counter.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/counter/index.tsx" style={{ height: '6em' }}>
```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count.value}</p>
      <button onClick$={() => count.value++}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

## Props

Props are used to pass data from the parent into the component. Props are accesible via the `props` argument to the component$ function.

In this example a component `Item` declares optional `name`, `quantity`, `description`, and `price`.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/component/props/index.tsx" style={{ height: '10em' }}>
```tsx {3-8, 27} /ItemProps/
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

interface ItemProps {
  name?: string;
  quantity?: number;
  description?: string;
  price?: number;
}

export const Item = component$<ItemProps>((props) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>name: {props.name}</li>
      <li>quantity: {props.quantity}</li>
      <li>description: {props.description}</li>
      <li>price: {props.price}</li>
    </ul>
  );
});

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Props</h1>
      <Item name="hammer" price={9.99} />
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

> In the example above we are using `component$<ItemProps>` to provide an explicit type for the props. This is optional but it allows the TypeScript compiler to check that the props are used correctly.

### Default props

You can use the destructuring pattern with props to provide default values.

```tsx
interface Props {
  enabled?: boolean;
  placeholder?: string;
}

// We can use JS's destructuring of props to provide a default value.
export default component$<Props>(({enabled = true, placeholder = ''}) => {
  return (
    <input disabled={!enabled} placeholder={placeholder} />
  );
});
```

## Rendering on Reactivity

Qwik components are reactive. This means that they automatically update on a state change. There are two kinds of updates:

1. A state is bound to a DOM text or attribute. Such changes usually directly update the DOM and do not require component function re-execute.
2. A state causes a structural change to the DOM (elements are created and or removed). Such changes require component function to re-execute.

The thing to keep in mind is that when state changes your component function may execute zero or more times depending on what the state is bound to. For this reason, the function should be idempotent and you should not rely on the number of times it executes.

A state change causes the component to get invalidated. When components get invalidated, they are added to the invalidation queue, which is flushed (rendered) on the next `requestAnimationFrame`. This acts as a form of coalescing for component rendering.

## Getting hold of DOM element

Use `ref` to get hold of a DOM element. Create a signal to store DOM element. Then pass the signal to the JSX `ref` property.

> Getting a reference to DOM elements can be useful to calculate the element size (`getBoundingClientRect`), computed styles, initializing a WebGL canvas, or even wire-up some third-party library that interacts with DOM elements directly.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/component/ref/index.tsx" style={{ height: '10em' }}>
```tsx /const outputRef = useSignal<Element>();/ /ref={outputRef}/
import { component$, useVisibleTask$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const width = useSignal(0);
  const height = useSignal(0);
  const outputRef = useSignal<Element>();

  useVisibleTask$(() => {
    if (outputRef.value) {
      const rect = outputRef.value.getBoundingClientRect();
      width.value = Math.round(rect.width);
      height.value = Math.round(rect.height);
    }
  });

  return (
    <section>
      <article
        ref={outputRef}
        style={{ border: '1px solid red', width: '100px' }}
      >
        Change text value here to stretch the box.
      </article>
      <p>
        The above red box is {height.value} pixels high and {width.value}{' '}
        pixels wide.
      </p>
    </section>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

## Accessing Elements by `id` Across Server and Client Environments

In server and client environments, elements must sometimes be accessed by their `id`. Use the `useId()` function to get a unique identifier for the current component that remains consistent across server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side operations. This is pivotal when server-rendered components need client-side scripting, such as:

1. **Animation Engines**
2. **Accessibility Enhancement**
3. **Other Client-Side Libraries**

In a microfrontends setup, where multiple fragments run concurrently, `useId()` ensures unique and consistent IDs across execution environements, eliminating conflicts.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/component/useId/index.tsx" style={{ height: '10em' }}>
```tsx /const outputRef = useSignal<Element>();/ /ref={outputRef}/
import { component$, useId, useSignal, useVisibleTask$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const elemIdSignal = useSignal<string | null>(null);
  const id = useId();
  const elemId = `${id}-example`;
  console.log('server-side id:', elemId);

  useVisibleTask$(() => {
    const elem = document.getElementById(elemId);
    elemIdSignal.value = elem?.getAttribute('id') || null;
    console.log('client-side id:', elemIdSignal.value);
  });

  return (
    <section>
      <div id={elemId}>
        Both server-side and client-side console should match this id:
        <br />
        <b>{elemIdSignal.value || null}</b>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

## Lazy Loading

The component also serves an important role when breaking parent-child relationships for bundling purposes.

```tsx
export const Child = () => <span>child</span>;

const Parent = () => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
);
```

In the above example, referring to the `Parent` component implies a transitive reference to the `Child` component. When the bundler is creating a chunk, a reference to `Parent` necessitates bundling `Child` as well. (`Parent` internally refers to `Child`.) These transitive dependencies are a problem because it means that having a reference to the root component will transitively refer to the remainder of the application—something which Qwik tries to avoid explicitly.

To avoid the above problem we don't refer to components directly, instead, we refer to the lazy wrapper. This is created automatically by the `component$()` function.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/component/lazy/index.tsx" style={{ height: '4em' }} sandbox={false}>
```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const Child = component$(() => {
  return <p>child</p>;
});

export const Parent = component$(() => {
  return (
    <section>
      <Child />
    </section>
  );
});

export default Parent;
```
</CodeSandbox>

In the above example the Optimizer transforms the above to:

```tsx
const Child = componentQrl(qrl('./chunk-a', 'Child_onMount'));
const Parent = componentQrl(qrl('./chunk-b', 'Parent_onMount'));
const Parent_onMount = () => qrl('./chunk-c', 'Parent_onRender');
const Parent_onRender = () => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
);
```

> **NOTE**
> For simplicity, not all of the transformations are shown; all resulting symbols are kept in the same file for succinctness.

Notice that after the Optimizer transforms the code, the `Parent` no longer directly references `Child`. This is important because it allows the bundler (and tree shakers) to freely move the symbols into different chunks without pulling the rest of the application with it.

So what happens when the `Parent` component needs to render a `Child` component, but the `Child` component has not yet been downloaded? First, the `Parent` component renders its DOM like so.

```html
<main>
  <section>
    <!--qv--><!--/qv-->
  </section>
</main>
```

As you can see in the above example, the `<!--qv-->` acts as a marker where the `Child` component will be inserted once it is lazy-loaded.

## Inline Components

In addition to the standard `component$()` with all of it's lazy-loaded
properties, Qwik also supports lightweight (inline) components that act more
like components in traditional frameworks.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/component/inline-child/index.tsx" style={{height: '4em'}}>
```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

// Inline component: declared using a standard function.
export const MyButton = (props: { text: string }) => {
  return <button>{props.text}</button>;
};

// Component: declared using `component$()`.
export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <p>
      Some text:
      <MyButton text="Click me" />
    </p>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

In the above example, `MyButton` is an inline component.
Unlike the standard `component$()`, inline components cannot be individually
lazy-loaded; instead, they are bundled with their parent component. In this case:

- `MyButton` will get bundled with the `default` component.
- Whenever `default` is rendered, it will also guarantee that `MyButton` is
rendered.

You can think of inline components as being inlined into the component where they are instantiated.

### Limitations
Inline components come with some limitations that the standard `component$()`
does not have. Inline components:
- Cannot use `use*` methods such as `useSignal` or `useStore`.
- Cannot project content with a `<Slot>`.

As the name implies, inline components are best used sparingly for
lightweight pieces of markup since they offer the convenience of being
bundled with the parent component.


## API Overview

### State

- [`useSignal(initialState)`](../state/index.mdx#usesignal) - creates a reactive value
- [`useStore(initialStateObject)`](../state/index.mdx#usestore) - creates a reactive object that can be used to store state
- [`createContextId(contextName)`](../context/index.mdx#createcontext) - creates a context reference
- [`useContextProvider()`](../context/index.mdx#usecontextprovider) - provides a value to a given context
- [`useContext()`](../context/index.mdx#usecontext) - reads the value of the current context

### Styles

- [`useStylesScoped$()`](../styles/index.mdx#usestylesscoped) - appends scoped styles to the component
- [`useStyles$()`](../styles/index.mdx#usestyles) - appends unscoped styles to the component

### Events

- [`useOn()`](../events/index.mdx) - appends a listener to the current component programmatically
- [`useOnWindow()`](../events/index.mdx) - appends a listener to the window object programmatically
- [`useOnDocument()`](../events/index.mdx) - appends a listener to the document object programmatically

### Tasks/Lifecycle
