# State

State management is an important part of any app. In Qwik, we can differentiate between two types of state, reactive and static:

1. Static state is anything that can be serialized: a string, number, object, array... anything.
2. A reactive state on the other hand is created with `useSignal()` or `useStore()`.

It is important to notice that state in Qwik is not necessarily a local component state, but rather an app state that can be instantiated by any component.

## `useSignal()`

Use `useSignal()` to create a reactive signal (a form of state). The `useSignal()` takes an initial value and returns a reactive signal.

The reactive signal returned by `useSignal()` consists of an object with a single property `.value`. If you change the `value` property of the signal, any component that depends on it will be updated automatically.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/counter-signal/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '6em' }}>
```tsx {4} /count/
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);

  return (
    <button onClick$={() => count.value++}>
      Increment {count.value}
    </button>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

This example above shows how `useSignal()` can be used in a counter component to keep track of the count. Modifying the `count.value` property will cause the component to be updated automatically. For instance, when the property is changed in the button click handler as in the example above.

## `useStore()`

Works very similarly to `useSignal()`, but it takes an object as its initial value. One can think of a store as a multiple-value signal or an object made of several signals.

Use `useStore(initialStateObject)` hook to create a reactive object. It takes an initial object (or a factory function) and returns a reactive object.

> **NOTE** For reactivity to work as expected, make sure to keep a reference to the reactive object and not only to its properties. e.g. doing `let { count } = useStore({ count: 0 })` and then mutating `count` won't trigger updates of components that depend on the property.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/counter-store/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '6em' }} >
```tsx {4} /state/ /count/#a
import { component$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const state = useStore({ count: 0 });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick$={() => state.count++}>Increment</button>
      <div>Count: {state.count}</div>
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

This example above shows how `useStore()` can be used in a counter component to keep track of the count.

### Recursive values

By default, [`useStore()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/state/index.mdx#usestore) only tracks the top-level properties in your store, which means that for an update to be registered, you have to update values at the top level property.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/counter-store-no-track/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '10em' }}>
```tsx
import { component$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    nested: { fields: { are: 'not tracked' } },
  });

  return (
    <>
      <p>{store.nested.fields.are}</p>
      <button onClick$={() => (store.nested.fields.are = 'tracked')}>
        Clicking me does not work
      </button>
      <br />
      <button onClick$={() => (store.nested = { fields: { are: 'tracked' } })}>
        Click me works
      </button>
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

For the updates to be registered with the default tracking strategy, we would have to update the top-level `nested` field like so:

```ts
store.nested = { fields: { are: 'tracked' } };
```

To make the first example work, we can pass a second argument to `useStore()`, and tell it to use recursion to track all the values in our store, no matter how deep.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/counter-store-deep/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '10em' }}>
```tsx
import { component$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const store = useStore(
    {
      nested: { fields: { are: 'not tracked' } },
    },
    { deep: true }
  );

  return (
    <>
      <p>{store.nested.fields.are}</p>
      <button onClick$={() => (store.nested.fields.are = 'tracked')}>
        Clicking me works because store is deep watched
      </button>
      <br />
      <button onClick$={() => (store.nested = { fields: { are: 'tracked' } })}>
        Click me still works
      </button>
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

Now, the component will update as expected. This will also track individual values inside of arrays!

## Computed state

The computed state is derived from the existing state.

In Qwik there are two ways to create computed values, each with a different use case (in order of preference):

1. `useComputed$()`: `useComputed$()` is the preferred way of creating computed values. Use it when the computed value can be derived synchronously purely from the source state (current application state). For example, creating a lowercase version of a string or combining first and last name into a full name.
2. [`useResource$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/resource/index.mdx): `useResource$()` is used when the computed value is asynchronous or the state comes from outside of the application. For example, fetching the current weather (external state) based on a current location (application internal state).

The way to think about the above is that they observe the existing state, and when the state changes the computed value is recomputed. The result is a newly computed value which is a signal returned from `useComputed$()` or `useResource$()`.

In addition to the two ways of creating computed values described above, there is also a lower-level ([`useTask$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/tasks/index.mdx#usetask) and [`useVisibleTask$()`](/docs/components/tasks/#usevisibletask)) way of modifying/creating state as a result of input change. This way does not produce a new signal, but rather modifies the existing state or produces a side effect.:

### `useComputed$()`

Use `useComputed$` to create a computed value that can be derived synchronously from the existing application state.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/computed/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '8em' }}>
```tsx {5} /useComputed$/
import { component$, useComputed$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const name = useSignal('Qwik');
  const capitalizedName = useComputed$(() => name.value.toUpperCase());

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" bind:value={name} />
      <div>Name: {name.value}</div>
      <div>Capitalized name: {capitalizedName.value}</div>
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

> **NOTE** Because `useComputed$()` is synchronous it is not necessary to explicitly track the input signals.

### `useResource$()`

Use `useResource$()` to create a computed value that is derived asynchronously or requires an external state (such as talking to a REST endpoint.)

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/resource/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '8em' }}>
```tsx {11} /useResource$/
import {
  component$,
  Resource,
  useResource$,
  useSignal,
} from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const prNumber = useSignal(3576);

  const prTitle = useResource$(async ({ track }) => {
    track(()=> prNumber); // Requires explicit tracking of inputs
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.github.com/repos/BuilderIO/qwik/pulls/${prNumber.value}`
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    return (data.title || data.message || 'Error') as string;
  });

  return (
    <>
      <input type="number" bind:value={prNumber} />
      <h1>
        PR#{prNumber}:
        <Resource
          value={prTitle}
          onPending={() => <>Loading...</>}
          onResolved={(title) => <>{title}</>}
        />
      </h1>
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

While it is possible to use `useResource$()` without `<Resource>` component, it is provided for convenience. The `<Resource>` component automatically shows a fallback content while the resource is being computed.

> **NOTE**: During SSR the `<Resource>` component will pause rendering until the resource is resolved. This way the SSR will not render with the loading indicator.

## Passing state

One of the nice features of Qwik is that the state can be passed to other components. Writing to the store will then only re-render the components which read from the store only.

There are two ways to pass state to other components:

1. pass state to child component explicitly using props,
2. or pass state implicitly through context.

### Using props

The simplest way to pass the state to other components is to pass it through props.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/passing-props/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '6em' }}>
```tsx {9} /userData=/
import { component$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const userData = useStore({ count: 0 });
  return <Child userData={userData} />;
});

interface ChildProps {
  userData: { count: number };
}
export const Child = component$<ChildProps>(({ userData }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick$={() => userData.count++}>Increment</button>
      <div>Count: {userData.count}</div>
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

### Using context

The context API is a way to pass state to components without having to pass it through props (i.e.: avoids prop drilling issues). Automatically, all the descendant components in the tree can access a reference to the state with read/write access to it.

Check the [context API](../context/index.mdx) for more information.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/passing-context/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '6em' }}>
```tsx /userData/ /export const CTX = createContextId<{ count: number }>('stuff');/ /useContextProvider(CTX, userData);/ /const userData = useContext(CTX);/
import {
  component$,
  createContextId,
  useContext,
  useContextProvider,
  useStore,
} from '@builder.io/qwik';

// Declare a context ID
export const CTX = createContextId<{ count: number }>('stuff');

export default component$(() => {
  const userData = useStore({ count: 0 });

  // Provide the store to the context under the context ID
  useContextProvider(CTX, userData);

  return <Child />;
});

export const Child = component$(() => {
  const userData = useContext(CTX);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick$={() => userData.count++}>Increment</button>
      <div>Count: {userData.count}</div>
    </>
  );
});
```
</CodeSandbox>

## `noSerialize()`

Qwik ensures that all application state is always serializable. This is important to ensure that Qwik applications have a [resumability](/docs/(qwik)/concepts/resumable/index.mdx) property. At times it is necessary to store data that can't be serialized. For example a reference to a third-party library such as [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). In such a situation use `noSerialize()` to mark the value as non-serializable.

If a value is marked as non-serializable then that value will not survive serialization events such as resuming the application on the client from server SSR. In such a situation the value will be set to `undefined` and it is up to the developer to re-initialize the value on the client.

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/state/no-serialize/index.tsx" sandboxStyle={{ height: '8em' }}>
```tsx /noSerialize/
import {
  component$,
  useStore,
  noSerialize,
  useVisibleTask$,
} from '@builder.io/qwik';
import Monaco from './monaco';

export default component$(() => {
  const state = useStore<{ monacoInstance: Monaco | undefined }>({
    // Don't initialize on server
    monacoInstance: undefined,
  });

  useVisibleTask$(() => {
    // Monaco is not serializable, so we can't serialize it as part of SSR
    // We can however instantiate it on the client after the component is visible
    setTimeout(() => (state.monacoInstance = noSerialize(new Monaco())), 1000);
  });
  return <div>{state.monacoInstance ? 'Monaco is loaded' : 'loading...'}</div>;
});
```
