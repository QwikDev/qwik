# Generating Sitemaps

## Generating Sitemaps in SSG

By default, when Static Site Generated (SSG) pages are built, a [sitemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps) is generated for the site. The `sitemap.xml` is automatically generated based on the pages that were built. This means that if you have a page that is not built, it will not be included in the sitemap.

### Configuration

The sitemap can be configured using the adapter's vite config file. The example below is configuring the Cloudflare adapter. The default sitemap file path is `sitemap.xml`, but you can use the `sitemapOutFile` option to change the file path. 

```ts
  plugins: [
    cloudflarePagesAdapter({
      ssg: {
        include: ['/*'],
        origin: 'https://qwik.dev',
        sitemapOutFile: 'sitemap.xml',
      },
    }),
  ]
```

The `include` option is used to specify which pages should be built, which also adds them to the sitemap. Any pages added to the `exclude` option will also exclude them from the sitemap. 

The `origin` option is used to specify the origin of the site and is used to generate the absolute URLs for the sitemap.

### robots.txt

Depending on your site setup, you'll probably want to add a [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt) file to your site. This can be done by adding a `robots.txt` file to the `public` directory. Any file in the `public` directory is treated as a static file and deploy alongside the build. The following is an example of a `public/robots.txt` file:

```bash
User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/sitemap.xml
```

Note the added `Sitemap` directive to the `robots.txt` file which tells search engines where to find the sitemap for your site. Be sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with the hostname of your site.

## Generating Dynamic Sitemaps in SSR

In addition to generating sitemaps for Static Site Generation (SSG), you can also generate sitemaps dynamically with Server-Side Rendering (SSR). This is useful if your site has content that is not known at build time or is frequently updated.

To generate a dynamic sitemap in SSR, you can create a route that serves a `dynamic-sitemap.xml` file based on your siteâ€™s routes and other dynamic content. Below is an example of how to set this up.

### Create a Sitemap Function

First, create a function that generates the sitemap XML based on the routes you want to include. You can create this function in a file such as `src/routes/dynamic-sitemap.xml/create-sitemap.ts`:

```typescript
// src/routes/dynamic-sitemap.xml/create-sitemap.ts

export interface SitemapEntry {
  loc: string;
  priority: number;
}

export function createSitemap(entries: SitemapEntry[]) {
  const baseUrl = "https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>";

  return `
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9 http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd">
${entries.map(
  (entry) => `
    <url>
        <loc>${baseUrl}${entry.loc.startsWith("/") ? "" : "/"}${entry.loc}</loc>
        <priority>${entry.priority}</priority>
    </url>`,
)}
</urlset>`.trim();
}
```

### Set Up a Route for the Dynamic Sitemap

Next, set up a route that will use the sitemap function to generate the sitemap dynamically. Create a file like src/routes/dynamic-sitemap.xml/index.tsx:

```tsx
// src/routes/dynamic-sitemap.xml/index.tsx

import type { RequestHandler } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";
import { routes } from "@qwik-city-plan";
import { createSitemap } from "./create-sitemap";

export const onGet: RequestHandler = (ev) => {
  const siteRoutes = routes
    .map(([route]) => route as string)
    .filter(route => route !== "/");  // Exclude the '/' route

  const sitemap = createSitemap([
    { loc: "/", priority: 1 },  // Manually include the root route
    ...siteRoutes.map((route) => ({
      loc: route,
      priority: 0.9,  // Default priority, adjust as needed
    })),
  ]);

  const response = new Response(sitemap, {
    status: 200,
    headers: { "Content-Type": "text/xml" },
  });

  ev.send(response);
};
```

This route dynamically creates the sitemap XML based on the routes in your Qwik City application.

### robots.txt

To ensure that search engines know where to find your dynamic sitemap, you should also add or update your robots.txt file. Add the following line to your robots.txt file, which is typically located in your public directory:


```bash
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Uncomment the following line and replace <unindexedFolder> with the actual folder name you want to disallow
# Disallow: /<unindexedFolder>/

Sitemap: https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/dynamic-sitemap.xml
```

Be sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual site URL.

This setup will dynamically generate and serve a dynamic.sitemap.xml whenever it is requested, keeping it up to date with the latest routes and changes to your site.
