# Environment variables

Qwik apps can read environment variables in two main ways: **build-time variables** and **server-side variables**.

> `process.env` is a Node.js only API, and should be avoided at all costs.

## Build-time variables

Build-time variables are powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html). They are defined in `.env` files and are available **in the browser and in the server-side code**.

> **IMPORTANT! DO NOT** use `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_*` to store any sensitive information, such as API keys, secrets, passwords, etc. **Only public data**.

Notice that build-time variables should be considered as **public**, since they will be hardcoded in the browser build, which can be easily read by anyone.

Build-time variables are prefixed by default with `PUBLIC_` and can be accessed with with `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_*`.

```tsx title=".env" /PUBLIC_API_URL/#a
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

```tsx {4} /PUBLIC_API_URL/#a title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  // `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_*` variables can be read anywhere, including browser
  return <div>PUBLIC_API_URL: {import.meta.env.PUBLIC_API_URL}</div>
})
```

> `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_*` variables can be read anywhere, but do not put any sensitive information in them, since they will be visible to the client.

## Server-side variables

Server-side variables are fundamentally runtime variables that are only available in the server-side code.

They are not known at build-time and are not available in the browser, so they can be considered as **private**.

Server-side variables can only be accessed in server-only APIs that expose the `RequestEvent` object, such as `routeLoader$()`, `routeAction$()`, `server$()` and endpoint handlers such as `onGet`, `onPost`, `onRequest` etc.

```tsx /DB_PRIVATE_KEY/ title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import {
  routeLoader$,
  routeAction$,
  server$,
  type RequestEvent,
} from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onGet = (requestEvent: RequestEvent) => {
  console.log(requestEvent.env.get('DB_PRIVATE_KEY'));
};

export const onPost = (requestEvent: RequestEvent) => {
  console.log(requestEvent.env.get('DB_PRIVATE_KEY'));
};

export const useAction = routeAction$(async (_, requestEvent) => {
  console.log(requestEvent.env.get('DB_PRIVATE_KEY'));
});

export const useLoader = routeLoader$(async (requestEvent) => {
  console.log(requestEvent.env.get('DB_PRIVATE_KEY'));
});

export const serverFunction = server$(function () {
  // `this` is the `RequestEvent` object
  console.log(this.env.get('DB_PRIVATE_KEY'));
});
```

### Defining server-side variables

During development server-side variables can be defined in the `.env.local` file, this file is ignored by git by default, so it is safe to put sensitive information in it.

```env title=".env.local"
DB_PRIVATE_KEY=123456789
```

> Make sure you never commit `.env.local` files to git.

During production, **setting server-side variables is very platform specific**. Most of the platforms allow you to set environment variables from their dashboard, or CLI. Please, refer to your platform (cloudflare, vercel, netlify) documentation for more information.

### Accessing the environment variables in serverfull architecture (Example:Express)

For accessing the .env variables in serverfull architecture we need to use singleton design pattern, initialize the db in a plugin and access it with getDB wherever it is needed

```typescript title="src/util/db.ts"
let _db!: AppDatabase;

export function getDB() {
  // eslint-disable-next-line
  if (!_db) {
    throw new Error('DB not set');
  }
  return _db;
}

export async function initializeDbIfNeeded(factory: () => Promise<AppDatabase>) {
  // eslint-disable-next-line
  if (!_db) {
    _db = await factory();
  }
}
```

```typescript title="src/routes/plugin@db.ts"
export const onRequest: RequestHandler = async ({ env }) => {
  const url = env.get('PRIVATE_LIBSQL_DB_URL')!;
  const authToken = env.get('PRIVATE_LIBSQL_DB_API_TOKEN')!;
  await initializeDbIfNeeded(initLibSql(url, authToken));
};
```
