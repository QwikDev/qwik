# Debugging

## ✨ Save yourself a bit of time with 'click to source'

During development, you can quickly access the source code of any element on a webpage by holding Option (⌥) or Alt key,
click on whatever you're curious about, and Qwik will immediately open your source code right on top of that element.
Seriously, any component, link, header - you name it, you can peek at its code.

Qwik tries to guess what code editor you like to use.
If it guesses wrong, no biggie! Just give Qwik a hint by setting the `LAUNCH_EDITOR` environment variable.
For example, if you're on a Mac and use VS Code, you'd type `export LAUNCH_EDITOR=code` in your terminal.

Under the hood [launch-editor library](https://github.com/yyx990803/launch-editor/tree/master) is used, here are the [supported editors](https://github.com/yyx990803/launch-editor/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-editors)
