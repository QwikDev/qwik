# Rewrites

Sometimes you want to redirect a user from the current page to another page,
but you want to keep the current URL in the browser history.

Let's say a user tries to access an article which is indexed by its name,
e.g `/articles/qwik-is-very-quick`.
but in our code, we access it by its id, on our directory structure.

```
src/routes/articles/
├── [id]
├─── index.tsx
```


```tsx title="src/routes/plugin@article-rewrite.tsx"
import type { RequestHandler } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

export const onRequest: RequestHandler = async ({ url, rewrite }) => {
  const pattern = /^\/articles\/(.*)$/;
  // Detects /articles/<article-name>, returns null if url does not match the pattern.
  const match = url.pathname.match(pattern);
  if (match) {
    const articleName = match[1];
    const { id } = await db.getArticleByName(articleName);
    throw rewrite(`/articles/${id}`);
  }
};
```

The `rewrite()` function, which was destructured in the RequestHandler function arguments, is invoked with a pathname string.

```tsx
throw rewrite(`/articles/777/`);
```
