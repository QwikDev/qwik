# Project Structure

A typical Qwik project looks like this:

```bash
qwik-app-demo
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── router-head
│   │       └── router-head.tsx
│   ├── entry.ssr.tsx
│   ├── global.css
│   ├── root.tsx
│   └── routes
│       ├── flower
│       │   ├── flower.css
│       │   └── index.tsx
│       ├── index.tsx
│       └── layout.tsx
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

## Project files

### `src/routes/`

The `src/routes/` directory is a special directory where Qwik City will look for your pages. Folders and files inside this directory have a special meaning and they will be mapped to the URL of your app.

- `src/routes/index.tsx` is the homepage of your app.
- `src/routes/layout.tsx` is the root layout of your app, all pages will be rendered inside this layout.

> Refer to the [Routing](/docs/routing) section for more information.

### `src/components/`

The directory named `src/components/` follows a standard convention. It's present in all Qwik starters and you can rename it if you prefer. The `src/components/` directory is where to put your components (i.e. reusable pieces of code that can be used in multiple places). These components are not routes or layouts, but they can be referenced from within your route or layout code.


For example, a `Button` component should be inside `src/components/button/button.tsx`.

### `public/`

The `public/` directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and icons. When you build your app, these files will be copied to the `dist/` directory and served at the root.

Refer to [Vite configuration for more information](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#public-base-path).

### `src/entry.ssr.tsx`

The SSR entry point is the common entry point in all cases where the application is rendered outside of the browser.

- Server (express, cloudflare...)
- `start` command
- `preview` command
- `build` command

### `src/root.tsx`

The `src/root.tsx` file is the root of the application tree.  It is the entry point and is the first component that will be rendered.

### `src/global.css`

The `src/global.css` file is a global CSS file, if you need to define some CSS that is used in multiple places in your app, you can define it here.

The root component (`src/root.tsx`) imports this file by default.

### `tsconfig.json`

The `tsconfig.json` file contains the TypeScript compiler configuration. It's standard for any TypeScript project.

### `vite.config.ts`

Qwik uses Vite to build the project. The `vite.config.ts` file contains the Vite configuration. It's standard for any Vite project. Please refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more information.

## Utilities

Qwik has a utility command called `new` that allows developers to easily create new components and routes.

Let's say you wanted to create a new component called `Button`, you would run the command:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik new Button
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik new Button
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik new Button
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik new Button
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Maybe you want to create a new route for the /contact page. To do that, you could use the command:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik new /contact
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik new /contact
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik new /contact
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik new /contact
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

The following commands are consistent with Qwik's directory file structure, allowing you to scaffold components more quickly.

If we compare our `qwik-app-demo` from the top of the page, the additional changes would look like this:

```bash
qwik-app-demo
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── router-head
│   │       └── router-head.tsx
│   │       Button
│   │       └── button.tsx
│   ├── entry.ssr.tsx
│   ├── global.css
│   ├── root.tsx
│   └── routes
│       ├── flower
│       │   ├── flower.css
│       │   └── index.tsx
│       ├── contact
│       │   └── index.tsx
│       ├── index.tsx
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── service-worker.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

If you prefer to generate the `Button` component with the `Button/index.tsx` naming convention, you could use the command:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik new --barrel Button
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik new --barrel Button
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik new --barrel Button
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik new --barrel Button
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

In that case, the `src/components` folder would look like this:
```bash
src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── router-head
│   │       └── router-head.tsx
│   │       Button
│   │       └── index.tsx
```

> This feature was added in Qwik v1.2, and those using an older version will not see this functionality.
