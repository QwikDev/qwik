# Project Structure

A typical Qwik project looks like this:

```bash
qwik-app-demo
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── router-head
│   │       └── router-head.tsx
│   ├── entry.ssr.tsx
│   ├── global.css
│   ├── root.tsx
│   └── routes
│       ├── flower
│       │   ├── flower.css
│       │   └── index.tsx
│       ├── index.tsx
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── service-worker.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

## Project files

### `src/routes/`

The `src/routes/` directory is a special directory for Qwik City since it's the directory where Qwik City will look for your pages. Folders and files inside this directory have a special meaning and they will be mapped to the URL of your app.

- `src/routes/index.tsx` is the homepage of your app.
- `src/routes/layout.tsx` is the root layout of your app, all pages will be rendered inside this layout.

> Refer to the [Routing](/docs/routing) section for more information.

### `src/components/`

The `src/components/` directory is a directory by convention. All Qwik starters will have this directory, but you can change it if you want. This directory is where you should put your components, ie, reusable pieces of code that can be used in multiple places. They are not routes or layouts, but they can be used inside them.

For example, a `Button` component should be inside `src/components/button/button.tsx`.

### `public/`

The `public/` directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and icons. When you build your app, these files will be copied to the `dist/` directory and served at the root.

Refer to [Vite configuration for more information](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#public-base-path).

### `src/entry.ssr.tsx`

SSR entry point, in all cases the application is rendered outside the browser, this entry point will be the common one.

- Server (express, cloudflare...)
- npm run start
- npm run preview
- npm run build

### `src/root.tsx`

The `src/root.tsx` file is the entry point for the application tree. It's the first component that will be rendered. It's the root of the tree.

### `src/global.css`

The `src/global.css` file is a global CSS file, if you need to define some CSS that is used in multiple places in your app, you can define it here.

The root component (`src/root.tsx`) imports this file by default.

### `tsconfig.json`

The `tsconfig.json` file contains the TypeScript compiler configuration. It's standard for any TypeScript project.

### `vite.config.ts`

Qwik uses Vite to build the project. The `vite.config.ts` file contains the Vite configuration. It's standard for any Vite project. Please refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more information.

## Utilities

Qwik has a utility command called `new` that allows developers to easily create new components and routes.

Let's say you wanted to create a new component called `Button`, you would run the command:
```tsx
pnpm qwik new Button
```

Maybe you want to create a new route for the /contact page. To do that, you could use the command:
```tsx
pnpm qwik new /contact
```

The following commands are consistent with Qwik's directory file structure, allowing you to scaffold components more quickly.

If we compare our `qwik-app-demo` from the top of the page, the additional changes would look like this:

```bash
qwik-app-demo
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── router-head
│   │       └── router-head.tsx
│   │       Button
│   │       └── button.tsx
│   ├── entry.ssr.tsx
│   ├── global.css
│   ├── root.tsx
│   └── routes
│       ├── flower
│       │   ├── flower.css
│       │   └── index.tsx
│       ├── contact
│       │   └── index.tsx
│       ├── index.tsx
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── service-worker.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

If you prefer to generate the `Button` component with the `Button/index.tsx` naming convention, you could use the command:
```tsx
pnpm qwik new --barrel Button
```

In that case, the `src/components` folder would look like this:
```bash
src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── router-head
│   │       └── router-head.tsx
│   │       Button
│   │       └── index.tsx
```

> This feature was added in Qwik v1.2, and those using an older version will not see this functionality.
