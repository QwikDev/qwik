# Glob Import & Dynamic Import

As you probably know, Qwik takes care of lazy-loading for you in order to make your app performant and scalable by default.

As a consequence of this automatic optimization, you don't need to and shouldn't use vite's [dynamic imports](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#dynamic-import) feature as it conflicts with the [optimizer](<../../(qwik)/advanced/optimizer/index.mdx>).

But there are still some cases where you may need to import a lot of files from a directory and you may not want to type out all the file paths. For that kind of situation, you can use [`import.meta.glob`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#glob-import).

## import.meta.glob

The goal of using `import.meta.glob` is to allow you to create a wrapper component to which you can pass a name prop to chose which component you want to import:

```tsx
<MetaGlobComponent name="file-name" />
<MetaGlobComponent name="another-file-name" />
<MetaGlobComponent name="etc." />
```

As written in the Vite documentation, `import.meta.glob` comes with a few features that allow you to specify how to import your files.

By default you can simply use pattern matching to specify which files should be imported from which folder:

```tsx
const metaGlobComponents: Record<string, any> = await import.meta.glob('/src/components/*');
```

But you can also pass in additional options like [`import`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#named-imports), [`query`](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#custom-queries):

```tsx
const metaGlobComponents: Record<string, any> = await import.meta.glob('/src/components/*', {
  import: 'default',
  query: '?raw',
});
```

## How to

<CodeSandbox src="/src/routes/demo/cookbook/glob-import/">
```tsx
import {
  type Component,
  component$,
  useSignal,
  useTask$,
} from '@builder.io/qwik';

const metaGlobComponents: Record<string, any> = await import.meta.glob(
  '/src/examples/*',
  { import: 'default' }
);

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MetaGlobExample name="example1" />
      <MetaGlobExample name="example2" />
      <MetaGlobExample name="example3" />
    </div>
  );
});

export const MetaGlobExample = component$<{ name: string }>(({ name }) => {
  const MetaGlobComponent = useSignal<Component<any>>();
  const componentPath = `/src/examples/${name}.tsx`;

  useTask$(async () => {
    MetaGlobComponent.value = await metaGlobComponents[componentPath]();
  });

  return <>{MetaGlobComponent.value && <MetaGlobComponent.value />}</>;
});
```
