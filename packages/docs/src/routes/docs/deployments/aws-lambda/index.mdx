# AWS Adapter

Qwik City AWS Adapter allows you to connect Qwik City to [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_hel).

## Installation

To integrate the `aws-lambda` adapter, use the `add` command:

```shell
npm run qwik add aws-lambda
```

The adapter will add a new `vite.config.ts` within the `adapters/` directory, and a new entry file will be created, such as:

```shell
└── adapters/
    └── aws-lambda
        └── vite.config.ts
└── src/
    └── entry_aws-lambda.tsx
```

Additionally, within the `package.json`, the `build.server` and `serverless:preview` scripts will be updated.

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Deploy to AWS

Before deploy is need setup your [AWS Credentials](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials) underhood
the adapter  use [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/).

```shell
serverless deploy
```
Done!
