# Cloudflare Pages Adapter

Qwik City Cloudflare Pages adapter allows you to connect Qwik City to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Installation

To integrate the `cloudflare-pages` adapter, use the `add` command:


<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik add cloudflare-pages
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik add cloudflare-pages
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik add cloudflare-pages
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik add cloudflare-pages
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

The adapter will add a new `vite.config.ts` within the `adapters/` directory, and a new entry file will be created, such as:

```shell
â””â”€â”€ adapters/
    â””â”€â”€ cloudflare-pages/
        â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ entry.cloudflare-pages.tsx
```

Additionally, within the `package.json`, the `build.server` and `deploy` scripts will be updated.

Take note of your nodejs version in your local environment by running the `node -v` command:
```shell
node -v
v20.11.1
```

When using 

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm create qwik@latest
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm create qwik@latest
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn create qwik
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun create qwik@latest
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

to setup your Qwik app it will likely use a different nodejs version than what Cloudflare Pages uses by default (v16.20.2).

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `build.server` and `build.client`:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run build
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

After installing the integration the project is ready to be deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

If the nodejs version is different in your environment than Cloudflare Pages (v16.20.2) you'll need to add a `NODE_VERSION` environment variable and set the value to the version that you got from running the `node -v` command in your environment:

```shell
node -v
v20.11.1
```

To do this in Cloudflare go to **Workers & Pages > YOUR_PROJECT > Settings > Environment variables > Production (and Preview) > Add variables > Save **

Please refer to the [Cloudflare Pages docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-qwik-site/) for more information on how to deploy your site.

Note that you will need a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up?lang=en-US) in order to complete this step.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

The Cloudflare Pages adapter also supports Static Site Generation (SSG) by using the `ssg` property. 
This allows you to generate static HTML files for your application at build time, instead of rendering them at runtime.

```ts title="adapters/cloudflare-pages/vite.config.ts"
export default extendConfig(baseConfig, () => {
  return {
    build: {
      ssr: true,
      rollupOptions: {
        input: ['src/entry.cloudflare-pages.tsx', '@qwik-city-plan'],
      }
    },
    plugins: [
      cloudflarePagesAdapter(
       // ðŸ‘‡ THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO ADD ðŸ‘‡
       {
         ssg: {
           include: ['/*'],
           exclude: ['/shop/*'],
           origin: 'https://example.com',
       },
      }),
    ],
  };
});

```


#### `include`

The `include` array is used to specify which paths should be statically generated. It accepts wildcard behavior. 

#### `exclude`

The `exclude` array defines routes that should not be static generated and accepts wildcard behavior. 
`exclude` always take priority over include.

#### `origin`

The URL `origin`, which is a combination of the scheme (protocol) and hostname (domain). For example, `https://qwik.dev` has the protocol `https://` and domain `qwik.dev`. However, the `origin` does _not_ include a `pathname`.

The `origin` is used to provide a full URL during Static Site Generation (SSG), and to simulate a complete URL rather than just the `pathname`. 
For example, in order to render a correct canonical tag URL or URLs within the `sitemap.xml`, the `origin` must be provided too.

This is important because if you don't set it, cloudflare will use the specific deployment url instead.




## Advanced

### Cloudflare Pages Entry Middleware

When the `cloudflare-pages` adapter is added, a new entry file will be created at `src/entry.cloudflare-pages.tsx`. Below is an example of using the built-in middleware within the entry file.

```tsx title="src/entry.cloudflare-pages.tsx"
import {
  createQwikCity,
  type PlatformCloudflarePages,
} from '@builder.io/qwik-city/middleware/cloudflare-pages';
import qwikCityPlan from '@qwik-city-plan';
import { manifest } from '@qwik-client-manifest';
import render from './entry.ssr';

const fetch = createQwikCity({ render, qwikCityPlan, manifest });

export { fetch };
```

The compiled middleware will be built in the `server/` directory. Such directory also contains a `_worker.js` file which implements the application's request handling as per the [Cloudflare Pages Advanced Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/advanced-mode/#advanced-mode).
The file simply re-exports the produced `fetch` handler as shown below.

```tsx title="/dist/_worker.js"
import { fetch } from "../server/entry.cloudflare-pages";
export default { fetch };
```

- [Cloudflare Pages Middleware Source](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/tree/main/packages/qwik-city/middleware/cloudflare-pages/index.ts)
- [Cloudflare Pages Advanced Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/advanced-mode/)
- [Function Invocation Route Config](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/routing/#functions-invocation-routes)

### Cloudflare Pages Function Invocation Routes

Cloudflare Page's [function-invocation-routes config](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/routing/#functions-invocation-routes) can be used to include, or exclude, certain paths to be used by the worker functions. Having a `_routes.json` file gives developers more granular control over when your Function is invoked.

This is useful to determine if a page response should be Server-Side Rendered (SSR) or if the response should use a static-site generated (SSG) `index.html` file instead.

By default, the Cloudflare Pages adapter _does not_ include a `public/_routes.json` config, but rather it is auto-generated from the build by the Cloudflare adapter. An example of an auto-generated `dist/_routes.json` would be:

```json
{
  "include": ["/*"],
  "exclude": [
    "/_headers",
    "/_redirects",
    "/build/*",
    "/favicon.ico",
    "/manifest.json",
    "/service-worker.js",
    "/about"
  ],
  "version": 1
}
```

In the above example, it's saying _all_ pages should be SSR'd. However, the root static files such as `/favicon.ico` and any static assets in `/build/*` should be excluded from the Functions, and instead treated as a static file.

In most cases the generated `dist/_routes.json` file is ideal. However, if you need more granular control over each path, you can instead provide your own `public/_routes.json` file. When the project provides its own `public/_routes.json` file, then the Cloudflare adapter will not auto-generate the routes config and instead use the committed one within the `public` directory.

### Context

You may access Cloudflare Page's environment variables in the endpoint method's `platform` param:

```ts
export const onRequest = async ({ platform }) => {
  const secret = platform.env['SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN'];
};
```

Additionally, you may import the `RequestHandler` and `PlatformCloudflarePages` types to have type completions in your editor.

```tsx
import { type RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { type PlatformCloudflarePages } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/middleware/cloudflare-pages';

export const onGet: RequestHandler<PlatformCloudflarePages> = ({ platform }) => {
  //...
};
```
