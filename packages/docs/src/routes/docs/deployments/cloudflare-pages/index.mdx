# Cloudflare Pages Adapter

Qwik City Cloudflare Pages adapter allows you to connect Qwik City to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Installation

To integrate the `cloudflare-pages` adapter, use the `add` command:

```shell
npm run qwik add cloudflare-pages
```

The adapter will add a new `vite.config.ts` within the `adapters/` directory, and a new entry file will be created, such as:

```shell
└── adapters/
    └── cloudflare-pages/
        └── vite.config.ts
└── src/
    └── entry.cloudflare-pages.tsx
```

Additionally, within the `package.json`, the `build.server` and `deploy` scripts will be updated.

Take note of your nodejs version in your local environment by running the `node -v` command:
```shell
node -v
v20.11.1
```

When using `npm create qwik@latest` to setup your Qwik app it will likely use a different nodejs version than what Cloudflare Pages uses by default (v16.20.2).

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

After installing the integration using `npm run qwik add cloudflare-pages`, the project is ready to be deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

If the nodejs version is different in your environment than Cloudflare Pages (v16.20.2) you'll need to add a `NODE_VERSION` environment variable and set the value to the version that you got from running the `node -v` command in your environment:

```shell
node -v
v20.11.1
```

To do this in Cloudflare go to **Workers & Pages > YOUR_PROJECT > Settings > Environment variables > Production (and Preview) > Add variables > Save **

Please refer to the [Cloudflare Pages docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-qwik-site/) for more information on how to deploy your site.

Note that you will need a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up?lang=en-US) in order to complete this step.

## Advanced

### Cloudflare Pages Entry Middleware

When the `cloudflare-pages` adapter is added, a new entry file will be created at `src/entry.cloudflare-pages.tsx`. Below is an example of using the built-in middleware within the entry file.

```tsx title="src/entry.cloudflare-pages.tsx"
import {
  createQwikCity,
  type PlatformCloudflarePages,
} from '@builder.io/qwik-city/middleware/cloudflare-pages';
import qwikCityPlan from '@qwik-city-plan';
import { manifest } from '@qwik-client-manifest';
import render from './entry.ssr';

const fetch = createQwikCity({ render, qwikCityPlan, manifest });

export { fetch };
```

The compiled middleware will be built in the `server/` directory. Such directory also contains a `_worker.js` file which implements the application's request handling as per the [Cloudflare Pages Advanced Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/advanced-mode/#advanced-mode).
The file simply re-exports the produced `fetch` handler as shown below.

```tsx title="/dist/_worker.js"
import { fetch } from "../server/entry.cloudflare-pages";
export default { fetch };
```

- [Cloudflare Pages Middleware Source](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/tree/main/packages/qwik-city/middleware/cloudflare-pages/index.ts)
- [Cloudflare Pages Advanced Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/advanced-mode/)
- [Function Invocation Route Config](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/routing/#functions-invocation-routes)

### Cloudflare Pages Function Invocation Routes

Cloudflare Page's [function-invocation-routes config](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/routing/#functions-invocation-routes) can be used to include, or exclude, certain paths to be used by the worker functions. Having a `_routes.json` file gives developers more granular control over when your Function is invoked.

This is useful to determine if a page response should be Server-Side Rendered (SSR) or if the response should use a static-site generated (SSG) `index.html` file instead.

By default, the Cloudflare Pages adapter _does not_ include a `public/_routes.json` config, but rather it is auto-generated from the build by the Cloudflare adapter. An example of an auto-generated `dist/_routes.json` would be:

```json
{
  "include": ["/*"],
  "exclude": [
    "/_headers",
    "/_redirects",
    "/build/*",
    "/favicon.ico",
    "/manifest.json",
    "/service-worker.js",
    "/about"
  ],
  "version": 1
}
```

In the above example, it's saying _all_ pages should be SSR'd. However, the root static files such as `/favicon.ico` and any static assets in `/build/*` should be excluded from the Functions, and instead treated as a static file.

In most cases the generated `dist/_routes.json` file is ideal. However, if you need more granular control over each path, you can instead provide your own `public/_routes.json` file. When the project provides its own `public/_routes.json` file, then the Cloudflare adapter will not auto-generate the routes config and instead use the committed one within the `public` directory.

### Context

You may access Cloudflare Page's environment variables in the endpoint method's `platform` param:

```ts
export const onRequest = async ({ platform }) => {
  const secret = platform.env['SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN'];
};
```

Additionally, you may import the `RequestHandler` and `PlatformCloudflarePages` types to have type completions in your editor.

```tsx
import { type RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { type PlatformCloudflarePages } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/middleware/cloudflare-pages';

export const onGet: RequestHandler<PlatformCloudflarePages> = ({ platform }) => {
  //...
};
```
