# Google Cloud Run Middleware

Qwik City Cloud Run middleware allows you to run a Qwik City app [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

## Installation

To integrate the `Cloud Run` adapter, use the `add` command:

```shell
npm run qwik add cloud-run
```

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Production deploy

After running `npm run build` you will have 2 build folders.

- The `dist` folder will be created including all the static files.
- The `server` folder will be created including all node server files.

To deploy your app, you need to:

1. Have a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account

2. Install the `gcloud` CLI

   If you don't have gcloud, follow [Google Cloud's official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

3. Authenticate with the `gcloud` CLI

   To authenticate the `gcloud` CLI, run this command:

   ```shell
   gcloud auth login
   ```

   Grant the SDK access to the account you created in step 1.

4. Change the name of the deploy script

   Update the name of your Cloud Run app in the deploy script in your package.json.

   ```json
   "deploy": "gcloud run deploy my-cloud-run-app --source ."
   ```

5. Run deploy script

   Deploy to Google Cloud Run with:

   ```shell
   npm run deploy
   ```
