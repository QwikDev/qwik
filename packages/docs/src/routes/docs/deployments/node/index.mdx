# Node Middleware

Qwik City Node middleware allows you to connect Qwik City to a Node.js server which uses the common middleware functionality. Some Node servers include:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Fastify](https://fastify.io/)
- [Connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect)
- [Polka](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polka)

## Installation

To integrate the `node` adapter, use the `add` command:

- For [Express](https://expressjs.com/):

```shell
npm run qwik add express
```

- For [Fastify](https://fastify.io/)

```shell
npm run qwik add fastify
```

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Dev deploy

To deploy the application for development:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

## Production deploy

Since you are choosing Node, here you are in your own, after running `npm run build`:

- The `dist` folder will be created including all the static files.
- The `server` folder will be created including all node server files.

In order to deploy the server, you need to run the `server/entry.[server].js` file in the server of your choice, where `[server]` can be [express](https://expressjs.com/) or [fastify](https://fastify.io/).
