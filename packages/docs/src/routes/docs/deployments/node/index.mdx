# Node Middleware

Qwik City Node middleware allows you to connect Qwik City to a Node.js server which uses the common middleware functionality. Some Node servers include:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/)
- [Connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect)
- [Polka](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polka)

## Installation

To integrate the `node` adapter, use the `add` command:

- For [Express](https://expressjs.com/):

```shell
npm run qwik add express
```

- For [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/)

```shell
npm run qwik add fastify
```

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Dev serve

To deploy the application for development:

```shell
npm run serve
```

## Production deploy

Since you are choosing Node, here you are in your own, after running `npm run build`:

- The `dist` folder will be created including all the static files.
- The `server` folder will be created including all node server files.

In order to deploy the server, you need to run the `server/entry.[server].js` file in the server of your choice, where `[server]` can be [express](https://expressjs.com/) or [fastify](https://fastify.dev/).

It's **very important to correctly configure the `ORIGIN` env variable**, which is used to check against [CSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf). The origin must match the origin of the client application.

> For example, if you plan to deploy your application to `https://example.com/app`, then you need to set the `ORIGIN` environment variable to `https://example.com`.
>
> ```shell
> ORIGIN=https://example.com node server/entry.express
> ```

You can check [how to deploy with Docker here](/docs/cookbook/node-docker-deploy/index.mdx).

### CSRF Protection

By default, all Qwik City applications are protected against [CSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) for all POST, PATCH, DELETE form submits.

This protection is enabled by default and it's the reason why you need to set the `ORIGIN` environment variable when deploying your application for production.

If you want to disable CSRF protection, you can set `checkOrigin: false` in the `createQwikCity()` options in `src/entry.preview.tsx` or `src/entry.[server].tsx`:

```tsx {6} /checkOrigin/ title="entry.preview.tsx"
// ...
const { router, notFound, staticFile } = createQwikCity({
  render,
  qwikCityPlan,
  manifest,
  checkOrigin: false,
});
// ...
```
