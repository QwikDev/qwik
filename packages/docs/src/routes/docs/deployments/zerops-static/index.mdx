# Zerops Static Adapter

Qwik City Zerops Static adapter allows you to deploy SSG static app to [Zerops](https://zerops.io/).

> See example [qwik static app](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-qwik-static) for a quick start.

## Installation

To integrate the `zerops-static` adapter, use the `add` command:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik add zerops-static
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik add zerops-static
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik add zerops-static
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik add zerops-static
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

> It will automatically install the required dependencies, including the [Zerops CLI](https://docs.zerops.io/references/cli). Which will help you deploy to Zerops.

The adapter will add a new `vite.config.ts` within the `adapters/` directory, and a new entry file will be created, such as:

```shell
└── adapters/
    └── zerops-static/
        └── vite.config.ts
└── src/
    └── entry.express.tsx
└── zerops.yml
```

Additionally, within the `package.json`, the `build.server` and `deploy` scripts will be updated.

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `build.server` and `build.client`:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run build
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run build
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>


## Deploying to Zerops

Notice that you might need a [Zerops account](https://app.zerops.io/registration) in order to complete this step!

After installing the integration the project is ready to be deployed to Zerops. However, you will need to create a git repository and push the code to it.

1. Create a project in Zerops

Projects and services can be added either through a Project add wizard or imported using a YAML structure:

```yml
   project:
     name: recipe-qwik
   services:
     - hostname: app
       type: static
```

This creates a project called `recipe-qwik` with a Zerops `Static` service called `app`.

1. Open [Settings > Access Token Management](https://app.zerops.io/settings/token-management) in the Zerops app and generate a new access token.

2. Log in using your access token with the following command:

```bash
zcli login <token>
```

To deploy the application to Zerops:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run deploy
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run deploy
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run deploy
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run deploy
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>
