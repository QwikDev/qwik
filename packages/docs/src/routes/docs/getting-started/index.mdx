# Getting Started Qwikly

Qwik is a new kind of framework that is [resumable](../concepts/resumable/index.mdx) (no JS and no hydration), built for the edge and [familiar for React developers](../cheat/qwik-react/index.mdx).

- [Stackblitz Qwik + Vite](https://qwik.new)
- [Examples playground](/examples/reactivity/counter/)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher
- Your favorite IDE ([vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
- Start to [think qwik](../think-qwik/index.mdx)

## Creating an app using the CLI

The first step is to create an application. Qwik comes with a CLI that allows you to create a basic working skeleton of an application. We will use the CLI to create a blank starter so that you can quickly familiarize yourself with it. Qwik supports NPM, yarn and pnpm.

### Run the Qwik CLI in your shell

Choose the package manager you prefer and run one of the following command:

```shell
npm create qwik@latest
pnpm create qwik@latest
yarn create qwik@latest
```

The CLI will guide you through an interactive menu to set the project-name, select one of the starters and asks if you want to install the dependencies.

After your new app is created, you will see an output like the following in your terminal:

```shell
🐰 Let's create a Qwik app 🐇   v0.18.1

✔ Where would you like to create your new project? … qwik-app

✔ Select a starter › Basic App (QwikCity)

✔ Would you like to install pnpm dependencies? … yes

✔ Installing pnpm dependencies...


🦄  Success!  Project created in qwik-app directory

🐰 Next steps:
   cd qwik-app
   pnpm start

🔌 Integrations? Add Netlify, Cloudflare, Tailwind...
   pnpm qwik add

```

At this point, you will have a `qwik-app` directory, that contains the starter app.

## Running in development

Once the application is download.

1. Change into the directory created.

```shell
cd qwik-app
```

2. Invoke the dev server

```shell
npm start
pnpm start
yarn start
```

3. You should see a server running with your starter application

```shell

  VITE v4.0.1  ready in 515 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help

```

4. Visit http://localhost:5173/ to explore the app.

## Running in production

To run the application locally in production, run the following command:

```shell
npm run preview
```

It will build your application and the [Vite preview server](https://vitejs.dev/config/preview-options.html) to serve the application.

## Deployment

It's very easy to deploy your Qwik application to the cloud, as static files, or your own server.

Please check out the [deployment](/integrations/deployments/overview/index.mdx) section for more details.

## Other integrations

Qwik is designed to be integrated with other tools. Such as `vitest`, `tailwind`, `partytown`... run the following command to see the list of available integrations:

```shell
npm run qwik add
```

and don't forget to check the [integrations](/integrations/integration/overview/index.mdx) section for more details.
