# Astro

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a flexible meta-framework that accommodates a wide range of tools and integrations, enabling you to leverage numerous ecosystems.

It also allows you to write components using your favorite UI framework (or no framework at all) and renders your pages to static HTML at build time, or dynamically on the server using Server-Side Rendering (SSR). 

This results in a fast, SEO-friendly output that can be deployed to any static hosting environment or server.

> For more details on the integration and to view the source code, check out the [QwikDev Astro Integration on GitHub](https://github.com/QwikDev/astro).

## Astro instead of Qwik City

When integrating Astro with Qwik, it's important to note that Qwik City APIs are not compatible with Astro. 

Astro is a meta-framework that provides its own set of APIs and features for handling these concerns. 
These include but are not limited to:
- routing 
- pages
- layouts
- data fetching

> When using Qwik with Astro, use Astro's APIs instead of Qwik City's. This ensures your Qwik components work correctly in Astro. See the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build) for more details.

## @qwikdev/astro ðŸ’œ

This integration leverages the power of JavaScript Streaming inside of Astro, using Qwik components.

## Installation

### The `@qwikdev/astro` CLI ðŸ¦¾

To start a new Qwik Astro project, you can run the following command:

  <PackageManagerTabs>
  <span q:slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm create @qwikdev/astro
  ```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm create @qwikdev/astro
  ```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn create @qwikdev/astro
  ```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="bun">
  ```shell
  bun create @qwikdev/astro
  ```
  </span>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

  For more advanced CLI configuration options, see the [@qwikdev/astro CLI documentation](https://github.com/QwikDev/astro/blob/main/libs/create-qwikdev-astro/README.md).


### Existing projects

Astro comes with a command-line tool for incorporating built-in integrations: `astro add`. This command will:

1. Optionally install all required dependencies and peer dependencies
2. Optionally modify your `astro.config.*` file to apply the integration

To install `@qwikdev/astro`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm dlx astro add @qwikdev/astro
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npx astro add @qwikdev/astro
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn dlx astro add @qwikdev/astro
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bunx astro add @qwikdev/astro
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

### Setting up the TypeScript Config

When using Astro's integration CLI or manually adding the integration, Qwik needs the following in `tsconfig.json` for typescript to recognize Qwik's JSX types.

```ts
"compilerOptions": {
  "jsx": "react-jsx",
  "jsxImportSource": "@builder.io/qwik"
}
```

If you face any issues, please [post them on Github](https://github.com/QwikDev/astro/issues) and attempt the manual installation below.

### Manual Installation

First, install the `@qwikdev/astro` integration like so:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm install @qwikdev/astro
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm install @qwikdev/astro
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn add @qwikdev/astro
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun install @qwikdev/astro
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Typically, package managers install peer dependencies. However, if you get a `Cannot find package '@builder.io/qwik'` warning when starting Astro, install Qwik.

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm install @builder.io/qwik
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm install @builder.io/qwik
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn add @builder.io/qwik
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun install @builder.io/qwik
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Now, add the integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

```diff lang="js" "qwikdev()"
  // astro.config.mjs
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+ import qwikdev from '@qwikdev/astro';

  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    integrations: [qwikdev()],
    //             ^^^^^
  });
```
