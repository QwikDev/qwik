# Cypress 

With [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io), you can easily create tests for your modern web applications, debug them visually, and automatically run them in your continuous integration builds.


## Component testing

Cypress enables you to test your Qwik components 
in isolation with the help of the [cypress-ct-qwik](https://github.com/qwikifiers/cypress-qwik) community plugin.




## Usage

You can add Cypress easily by using the following Qwik starter script:


<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik add cypress
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik add cypress
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik add cypress
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik add cypress
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

This command adds `cypress` and `cypress-ct-qwik` to your dependencies, appends testing commands to your `package.json` 
scripts section and creates the configuration files needed to run component testing with Cypress.


For further reference, please check the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) and the [cypress-qwik documentation](https://github.com/qwikifiers/cypress-qwik).
