# Gel Data

[GelDB](https://www.geldata.com/) Gel is a scalable, integrated data platform on top of Postgres. 

Gel gives the relational model a fresh facelift, solves n+1, simplifies migrations, and streamlines your entire database workflow.

Gel can be used in Qwik with `routeLoader$`, `routeAction$` and `server$` functions. These are Qwik APIs to allow code to execute only on the server-side.

The simplest way to add Gel to your Qwik project is by running the Qwik CLI command. This will automatically install all necessary dependencies, set up a basic schema in the `dbschema` folder, and generate a `queries` directory to help you start building your own API queries. Additionally, it will scaffold `actions` and `hooks` folders with example routes and files, giving you a ready-to-use foundation for working with Gel in your app.

It will also create a `gel.toml` file to configure the gel instance. Everything you need to start building your app with Gel is there.

> Gel is a modern data platform built on PostgreSQL that provides a unified interface for managing, querying, and scaling your data. It offers features like real-time analytics, seamless migrations, and integrated workflows to simplify database operations for developers and teams.

## Auto-generating queries

Gel lets you automatically generate queries for your database schema by using their query language EdgeQL.
It is already installed for you and you can use the following scripts to utilize it:  

*** Before you start, make sure you have run the following command:
```shell
pnpm run gel:generate:all
```

The following `<generator>`s are currently supported:

- Command: `gel:generate:queries` > 
    - `queries`: Generate typed functions from *.edgeql files
- Command: `gel:generate:types` > 
    - `interfaces`: Generate interfaces for your schema types 
    - `edgeql-js`: Generate the query builder
- Command: `gel:generate:all` > 
    - `queries` + `interfaces` + `edgeql-js`




## Gel UI

You can also use the Gel UI to view and edit your database schema, query your data, among other things.
To do so, run the following command:
<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm run gel:ui
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run gel:ui
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run gel:ui
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run gel:ui
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Listing users

We will use `routeLoader$` to query all users in the DB, using `db.query.users.findMany()`, and returning the result.

```tsx {7} /Gel/ title="src/routes/users/index.tsx"
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import { routeLoader$ } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3";
import Database from "better-sqlite3";
import { schema } from "../../../drizzle/schema";

export const useGetUsers = routeLoader$(async () => {
  const sqlite = new Database("./drizzle/db/db.sqlite");
  const db = drizzle(sqlite, { schema });
  const users = await db.query.users.findMany();
  return users;
});

export default component$(() => {
  const users = useGetUsers();
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>User's directory</h1>
      <ul>
        {users.value.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>
            <a href={`/users/${user.id}`}>
              {user.name} ({user.email})
            </a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </section>
  );
});

```
