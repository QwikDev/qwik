# Gel Data

[GelDB](https://www.geldata.com/) Gel is a scalable, integrated data platform on top of Postgres. 

Gel gives the relational model a fresh facelift, solves n+1, simplifies migrations, 

and streamlines your entire database workflow.

Gel can be used in Qwik with `routeLoader$`, `routeAction$` and `server$` functions. These are Qwik APIs to allow code to execute only on the server-side.

The easiest way to add Gel to Qwik is using the Qwik CLI command. This will install the required dependencies and create a `gel` folder with the gel schema.

It will also create a `gel.toml` file to configure the gel instance. Everything you need to get started is there.

> Gel is a modern data platform built on PostgreSQL that provides a unified interface for managing, querying, and scaling your data. It offers features like real-time analytics, seamless migrations, and integrated workflows to simplify database operations for developers and teams.

## Auto-generating queries

Gel lets you automatically generate queries for your database schema by using

their query language EdgeQL combined with `npm install @gel/generate  --save-dev`.

The following `<generator>`s are currently supported:

- `queries`: Generate typed functions from *.edgeql files
- `interfaces`: Generate interfaces for your schema types
- `edgeql-js`: Generate the query builder
