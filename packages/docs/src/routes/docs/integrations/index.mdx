# Integrations

Qwik CLI comes with integrations to make it easy to connect to your tooling and services.

Once you create a Qwik City application, run the following command to add new integrations:


<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik add
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik add
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik add
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik add
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

This command will prompt you to select the integration you want to add. Once selected, the integration will be added to your application and you can start using it.

> **For Monorepos:** you can add integrations to a specific package by running the command with the `--projectDir=some/subDir` param.

If you'd like to add a Qwik library, please see the [Library](/docs/(qwik)/advanced/library/index.mdx) docs. If you'd like to add a new tooling or service integration, please read on.
