# Integrations

Qwik CLI comes with integrations to make it easy to connect to your tooling and services.

Once you create a Qwik City application, run the following command to add new integrations:

```shell
npm run qwik add
```

This command will prompt you to select the integration you want to add. Once selected, the integration will be added to your application and you can start using it.

If you'd like to add a Qwik library, please see the [Library](/docs/(qwik)/advanced/library/index.mdx) docs. If you'd like to add a new tooling or service integration, please read on.
