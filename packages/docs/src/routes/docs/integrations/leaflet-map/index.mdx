# LeafletJS Map

Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. 
Weighing just about 42 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.

Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. 
It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms, can be extended with lots of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to. [LeafletJS Map Website](https://leafletjs.com/)

## Usage

You can add LeafletJS Map easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm 
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik add leaflet-map
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik add leaflet-map
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik add leaflet-map
```
  </span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

The previous command updates your app with the necessary dependencies.
