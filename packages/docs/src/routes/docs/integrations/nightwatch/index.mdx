# Nightwatch

[Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org) is an integrated end-to-end testing framework powered by [W3C WebDriver API](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/), the standard for browser automation.
This allows Nightwatch to run e2e tests against _real browsers_ (not browser engines) on both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Usage

You can add Nightwatch easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

```shell
npm run qwik add nightwatch
```

This command will install `nightwatch` into your project, along with two other dependencies, add a `test.e2e` script to your `package.json`, and create a default configuration file named `nightwatch.conf.cjs`.
It will also add an example test within a newly created `test` folder which can be run against the Qwik starter application.

For further reference, please check the [Nightwatch documentation](https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/).
