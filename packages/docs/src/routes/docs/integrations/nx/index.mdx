# Nx and enterprise scale monorepos

[Nx](https://nx.dev/) is a robust and extensible development platform designed to simplify the management 
of large-scale monorepos containing multiple applications and libraries by offering powerful tools for code generation, 
build orchestration, dependency management, and code sharing.

Qwik integrates with nx beautifully by using the [qwik-nx](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-nx) plugin.


## Main features

* Generate a new Nx workspace using a "Qwik" preset
* Generate Qwik applications and libraries.
* Generate Qwik components and routes.
* Generate Storybook, React Qwikify, Cloudflare configuration and much more
* Run executors that are built specifically for building Qwik applications.


## Usage

You can generate a new workspace by running:

```shell
npx create-nx-workspace@latest org-workspace --preset=qwik-nx
```

Or add a new Qwik application to an existing workspace by running:

```shell
npm install -D qwik-nx
```

and then

```shell
nx generate qwik-nx:app
```

For further reference, please check the [qwik-nx documentation](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-nx).
