# Orama

[Orama](https://oramasearch.com/) is a fast, batteries-included, full-text search engine entirely written in TypeScript, with zero dependencies.

Orama could be used in Qwik on the client side or on the server side with `routeLoader$`, `routeAction$` and `server$` functions.

The easiest way to add Orama to Qwik is using the `pnpm qwik add orama` command. This will install the required dependencies and create a new public route `/src/routes/orama` to showcase the Orama integration.

```bash
npm run qwik add orama
```

> Orama has been designed to work on any runtime and has no dependencies. A JavaScript runtime is the only requirement. 

For further reference, please check the [Orama documentation](https://docs.oramasearch.com/).
