# Panda CSS

Panda is a styling engine that generates styling primitives to author atomic CSS and recipes in a type-safe and readable manner.
[Panda CSS Website](https://panda-css.com/)

## Usage

You can add Panda easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

```shell
npm run qwik add pandacss
```

The previous command updates your app with the necessary dependencies.

It also adds new files inside to your project folder:

- `postcss.config.js`
- `panda.config.js`
- `.vscode/settings.json`

and modifies your `src/global.css` to include

```css title="src/global.css"

# global.css file

@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;

...stuff...

```
