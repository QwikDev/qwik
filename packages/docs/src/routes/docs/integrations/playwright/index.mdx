# Playwright

Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps supporting all modern rendering engines and works cross-platform. [Playwright Website](https://playwright.dev/).

## Usage

You can add Playwright easily by using the following Qwik starter script:


<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik add playwright
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik add playwright
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik add playwright
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik add playwright
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

The previous command adds playwright to your dependencies, appends a `test.e2e` command in your `package.json` scripts section and creates a default configuration within the `playwright.config.ts` file on the application root level.
It also adds a new file within a newly created `tests` folder called `example.spec.ts` which contains some simple test cases.

For further reference, please check the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
