# Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. It's open source and free.

Since version 7.0, Storybook supports Vite natively, which means it has first-class support for Qwik too.

## Usage

You can add Storybook to your existing app, or library use:

```shell
npm run qwik add storybook
```

The previous command installs the necessary dependencies and adds an example component and stories

Now you can run serve the Storybook dashboard:

```shell
npm run storybook
```
