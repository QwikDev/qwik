# Tauri

Tauri is a framework to build desktop applications with any frontend framework and a Rust core.

Learn more on the [Tauri website](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/qwik/).

## Adapter
Make sure you use the [Static Adapter](https://qwik.dev/docs/deployments/static/).

Then you can build your app with 

```shell
npm run build
```

## Add Tauri

To install Tauri via npm run:

```shell
npm install -D @tauri-apps/cli
```

In your `package.json`, add this script:

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "tauri": "tauri"
}
```

Then, to scaffold a minimal Rust project that is pre-configured to use Tauri, open a terminal and run the following command:
```shell
npm run tauri init
```
This command will walk you through a quick setup:
1. *What is your app name?*
This will be the name of your final bundle and what the OS will call your app. You can use any name you want here.
1. *What should the window title be?*
This will be the title of the default main window. You can use any title you want here.
3. *Where are your web assets (HTML/CSS/JS) located relative to the `<current dir>/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file that will be created?*
This is the path that Tauri will load your frontend assets from when building for production.
Use `../dist` for this value.
4. *What is the URL of your dev server?*
This can be either a URL or a file path that Tauri will load during development.
Use `http://localhost:5173` for this value.
5. *What is your frontend dev command?*
This is the command used to start your frontend dev server.
Use `npm run dev` **(make sure to adapt this to use the package manager of your choice)**.
6. *What is your frontend build command?*
This is the command to build your frontend files.
Use `npm run build` **(make sure to adapt this to use the package manager of your choice)**.

That's it! Finally you can run this command to start developing your app:
```shell
npm run tauri dev
```
