# Qwik Testing Library

⚡ Simple and complete Qwik DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices.

[Qwik Testing Library][qwik-testing-library] is a lightweight library for testing Qwik
components. It provides functions on top of [Qwik][qwik] and
[DOM Testing Library][dom-testing-library] so you can mount Qwik components and query their
rendered output in the DOM. Its primary guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you.][guiding-principle]

Note that because [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used by default for Qwik projects, the Qwik Testing Library
integration was configured to run tests with [Vitest][vitest].

## Usage

You can add Qwik Testing Library easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik add testing-library
```
</span>
<span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik add testing-library
```
</span>
<span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik add testing-library
```
</span>
<span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik add testing-library
```
</span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

After running the command, qwik-testing-library will be installed, configured, and a new component will be added to
your project.

The component will be added to the `src/components/example` directory along with a new unit test
named `example. spec.tsx`.

```tsx title="example.spec.tsx"
// import qwik-testing methods
import { screen, render, waitFor } from "@noma.to/qwik-testing-library";
// import the userEvent methods to interact with the DOM
import { userEvent } from "@testing-library/user-event";
// import the component to be tested
import { ExampleTest } from "./example";

// describe the test suite
describe("<ExampleTest />", () => {
  // describe the test case
  it("should increment the counter", async () => {
    // setup user event
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    // render the component into the DOM
    await render(<ExampleTest />);

    // retrieve the 'increment count' button
    const incrementBtn = screen.getByRole("button", {
      name: /increment counter/i,
    });
    // click the button twice
    await user.click(incrementBtn);
    await user.click(incrementBtn);

    // assert that the counter is now 2
    expect(await screen.findByText(/count:2/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
