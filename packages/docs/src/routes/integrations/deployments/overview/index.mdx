# Deployments

When it's time to deploy your application, Qwik comes with ready-to-use integration that make this so easy!

```shell
npm run qwik add
```

## Adaptors and Middleware

Qwik City middleware is a glue code that connects server rendering framework (such as Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, Express etc.) with the Qwik City meta-framework.

Qwik City comes pre-bundled with:

- [Azure Static Web Apps](../azure-swa/index.mdx)
- [Cloudflare Pages](../cloudflare-pages/index.mdx)
- [Netlify Edge](../netlify-edge/index.mdx)
- [Vercel Edge](../vercel-edge/index.mdx)
- [Node](../node/index.mdx)
- [Google Cloud Run](../gcp-cloud-run/index.mdx)

## Production build

When a new integration is added to the project, a `build.server` script is added to the `package.json` file. This script is used to build the project for production.

The only thing you need to do is to run the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

> Under the hood, the `build` script will execute, `build.server` and `build.client` scripts.

## Advanced

The `requestHandler()` utility is what each of the above middleware bundles uses in order to translate their request/response to a standard format for Qwik City to use. This function can be used to provide middleware for specific server frameworks.

If there's middleware missing and you'd like it added, take a look at how the `requestHandler()` utility is used to handle requests for each of the middleware source-code above. Better yet, we'd love to have your middleware contributions! [PR's are welcome](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/tree/main/packages/qwik-city/middleware)!
