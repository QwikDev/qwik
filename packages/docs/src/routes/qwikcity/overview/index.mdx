# Qwik City (routing)
*aka. Qwik Router*

Learning Qwik and Qwik City are not two different things, Qwik City is built on top of Qwik, bringing opinionated routing and goodies to make your life easier.

> Qwik¹ City²
>
> [**Qwik¹**](../../docs/overview/index.mdx): Core framework, stable, primitives, component model.
>
> [**City²**](../directory-layout/index.mdx): Opinionated file-based router, build fast.

We call it a **meta-framework** for Qwik. Qwik City is to Qwik, what [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is to React, what [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) is to Vue, or [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to Svelte.

Qwik (core) and Qwik City (routing) solve problems at two layers of abstraction. **Qwik can stay stable**, without breaking changes, focusing on long-term and stable primitives, while Qwik City brings an **opinionated and performant way to build sites at scale**. We don't want to lock the ecosystem into a single correct way of building sites, in fact we encourge the community to build alternative solutions on top Qwik.

> As a user, using Qwik City today for your app is a no-brainer. Thanks to Qwik architecture, it comes with zero overhead, meaning that no extra JS will be delivered to the browser.


Use Qwik City to build an e-commerce website, blog site, or any other website that needs routing, layouts, templating, or data retrieval/updates. Qwik City is built on Qwik, and therefore Qwik City sites are resumable and only download the minimal amount of JavaScript with fine-grained lazy loading.

Qwik City provides:

- Directory-based routing
- Nested layouts
- File-based menus
- Breadcrumbs
- Support authoring content with `.tsx` or `.mdx` file formats
- Data endpoints

By default, Qwik City sites are fast because they:

- Are resumable
- Download minimal JavaScript
- Come with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io)

To follow along with this guide, run the Qwik CLI in your command line:

```bash
npm create qwik@latest
```

When prompted, choose a name for your project and Basic as your starter.

> Note: the `start` script attempts to launch the site in system’s browser,
> which in headless environments (e.g., within a container)
> could cause the command to fail with an error.
> Edit `package.json` to remove the `--open` flag.
