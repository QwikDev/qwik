One of Qwik's super powers lies in its lazy-loading features. Each component will generate a separate Symbol which is downloaded on demand. This allows you to build a large application with many components and only download the components that are needed for the current view.

But for some cases you may want to load a component together with the parent component. For example, if you have a `<Greeter>` component that is always used with the `<App>` component, you may want to load the `<Greeter>` component with the `<App>` component. This is called an [inline component](/docs/(qwik)/core/overview/index.mdx#inline-components).

In this example, the `<App>` and a `<Greeter>` components are prepared for you. The `<Greeter />` component is declared using the [`component$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/overview/index.mdx#component) method and is a Qwik component. Remove the [`component$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/overview/index.mdx#component) to convert `<Greeter>` to a [inline component](/docs/(qwik)/core/overview/index.mdx#inline-components).

Open the `Symbols` tab and notice that the `<Greeter />` component is no longer an independent export, but instead is bundled as part of the `<App>` component.
