For this tutorial, we would like to fetch the list of repositories for a given GitHub organization. To aid you, we have added the `getRepositories()` function to the bottom of the file. Your task is to use the `getRepositories()` function to fetch the list of repositories whenever the user updates the `org` input.

Qwik provides [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) to help you lazily fetch and display data from the server. It returns an `AsyncSignal<T>` which has these states:

- loading: the data is being fetched from the server => Render `loading...` indicator. `.loading` is `true` while data is being fetched.
- resolved: the data has successfully been fetched from the server => Render the data. `.value` contains the last fetched data or the initial value.
- errored: the data could not be fetched from the server due to an error => Render the error. `.error` contains the error, if any.

These states are reactive, meaning that if you use them and they change, your component will automatically re-render to reflect the new state.

Note that when reading `.loading`, it will trigger the actual loading of the data. So you typically won't have to trigger the load manually.

## Fetching data

Use [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) to set up how the data is fetched from the server.

```jsx
  const reposResource = useAsync$<string[]>(({ track, abortSignal }) => {
    // We need a way to re-run fetching data whenever the `github.org` changes.
    // Use `track` to trigger re-running of this data fetching function.
    const org = track(githubOrg);

    // The abortSignal is automatically provided and will be aborted when this
    // function re-runs, allowing you to cancel pending operations.

    // Fetch the data and return the promises.
    return getRepositories(org, abortSignal);
  });
```

The [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function returns an `AsyncSignal` object, which is reactive state that can be serialized by Qwik. The [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function allows you to `track` store properties so that the [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function can be reactive on store changes. The `abortSignal` allows you to cancel pending operations when the function re-runs. Finally, the [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function returns a promise that will resolve to the value.

## Rendering data

The `AsyncSignal` provides the `.loading`, `.error`, and `.value` reactive properties to allow you to render different content depending if the resource is `pending`, `resolved` or `rejected`.

On the server, rendering pauses until the resource is resolved and will always render as either `resolved` or `rejected`. (On the client, all states including `pending` are rendered.)

```jsx
{reposResource.loading && <div>Loading...</div>}
{reposResource.error && <div>Error: {reposResource.error.message}</div>}
{reposResource.value && <div>{reposResource.value}</div>}
```

## SSR vs Client

Notice that the same code can render on both server and client (with slightly different behavior, which skips the `pending` state rendering on the server.)
