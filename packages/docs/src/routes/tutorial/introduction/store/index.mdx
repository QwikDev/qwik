Use `useStore()` to store the state of the component. The store's purpose is to:
1. store the state of the component
2. present the state as a proxy that can observe read/writes to the store
3. serialize the state of the store into JSON on application pause.
4. observe which properties of the store are used in a component template and create subscriptions to the store. The subscriptions are then used to automatically update the component template if a store changes.

Stores are declared inside the component's function using the `useStore()` function. Wrap the `github` assignment in the `useStore(...)` function call to create a store.

NOTE: In this example, the store never changes. Therefore there is no way to observe automatic template re-rendering. In the next example, we will add a listener to the `<input>` to demonstrate automatic template re-rendering.
