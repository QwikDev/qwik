Web applications are built up from components in the same way that general applications are built up from functions.

Composing functions would not be very useful if you couldn't pass in parameters. In the same way that functions have parameters, components have "props". A component uses props to pass data to its children components.

> **Your task**: Modify the code so that the parent `<App>` can pass `salutation="Hello"` and `name="World"` to the `<Greeter>`. Add properties to the `GreeterProps` interface and then add the necessary bindings.
