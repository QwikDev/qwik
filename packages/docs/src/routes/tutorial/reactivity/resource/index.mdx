For this tutorial, we would like to fetch the list of repositories for a given GitHub organization. To aid you, we have added the `getRepositories()` function to the bottom of the file. Your task is to use the `getRepositories()` function to fetch the list of repositories whenever the user updates the `org` input.

Qwik provides [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) to help you fetch and display data from the server. When fetching data the application can be in one of three states:

- `pending`: the data is being fetched from the server => Render `loading...` indicator.
- `rejected`: the data could not be fetched from the server due to an error => Render the error.
- `resolved`: the data has successfully been fetched from the server => Render the data.

Use [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function to set up how the data is fetched from the server.

## Fetching data

Use [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) to set up how the data is fetched from the server.
```jsx
  const reposResource = useAsync$<string[]>(({ track, abortSignal }) => {
    // We need a way to re-run fetching data whenever the `github.org` changes.
    // Use `track` to trigger re-running of this data fetching function.
    const org = track(githubOrg);
  
    // The abortSignal is automatically (lazily) provided and will be aborted when this
    // function re-runs, allowing you to cancel pending operations.
    return getRepositories(org, abortSignal);
  });
```

The [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function returns an `AsyncSignal`, which is reactive state that can be serialized by Qwik. The [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function allows you to `track` store properties so that the [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function can be reactive on store changes. The `abortSignal` allows you to cancel pending operations when the function re-runs. Finally, the [`useAsync$()`](/docs/(qwik)/core/state/index.mdx) function returns a promise that will resolve to the value.
  
## Rendering data

The `AsyncSignal` provides the `.loading` and `.error` reactive properties to allow you to render different content depending if the resource is `pending`, `resolved` or `rejected`.

During SSR, the rendering will pause until the `AsyncSignal` has loaded so it  will always render as either `resolved` or `rejected`.

```jsx
{reposResource.loading && <div>Loading...</div> ? reposResource.error ? <div>Error: {reposResource.error}</div> : <div>{reposResource.value}</div>}
```

## SSR vs Client

Notice that the same code can render on both server and client (with slightly different behavior, which skips the `pending` state rendering on the server.)
