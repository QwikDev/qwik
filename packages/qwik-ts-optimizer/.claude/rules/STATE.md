# Project state

Snapshot of where the active workstream stands. Read at the start of a session to rehydrate context fast. **Update aggressively** as meaningful progress lands — see "Maintenance" at the bottom.

Last updated: 2026-05-09 (post Sub-C / OSS-358 merged; **refactor track v2 fully closed** — `generateAllSegmentModules` orchestrator is now a 34-line sequencer)

## Goal

**Active workstream:** between workstreams. **Refactor track v2 ([OSS-343](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-343)) is fully closed** — every sub-issue is Done. OSS-344 (PR #12, predicates consolidation), OSS-345 (PR #13, immutable field maps), OSS-346 (PR #14, generateSegmentCode 9-phase sequencer), OSS-347 (PR #30, generateAllSegmentModules SPEC), OSS-356 (PR #32, Sub-A — Prep + inline-strategy + shared rawProps helper), OSS-357 (PR #34, Sub-B — migration-wiring + nested call-sites + nested QRL decls), OSS-358 (PR #35, Sub-C — final orchestrator shape). The `generateAllSegmentModules` orchestrator went from **580 → 459 → 214 → 34 lines (~94% reduction)** while preserving every test baseline. Doc/types/perf/process side-tracks shipped this session: OPTIMIZER.md walkthrough + Maintenance governance ([OSS-348](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-348), PR #15), REGRESSION.md mechanism rewrite (PR #16, no ticket), types.ts JSDoc parity ([OSS-349](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-349), PR #17), `extractSegments` `preParsedModule` plumbing ([OSS-350](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-350), PR #18), `extract.ts` JSX-extension fold-in ([OSS-351](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-351), PR #20), `extractSegments` closure-node threading + per-extraction body re-parse drop ([OSS-353](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-353), PR #22), `resolveConstLiterals` closure-form rewrite + prod-rename sync ([OSS-354](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-354), PR #23), portable benchmark harness ([OSS-355](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-355), PR #24), METHODOLOGIES post-merge cleanup routine codified (PR #26, no ticket — adds the four-step routine + STATE.md auto-merge carve-out), and `BENCHMARKS.md` perf-history doc bootstrapped with a 9-point backfill (PR #28, no ticket — see [`BENCHMARKS.md`](../../BENCHMARKS.md) at repo root). One backlog item filed during the OSS-351 review: [OSS-352](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-352) (`inlinedQrl` extension JSX-detection investigation).

**Long-term project goal:** 100% snapshot test parity between the TypeScript optimizer (this repo) and the SWC reference (`./swc-reference-only`), verified by `pnpm vitest convergence --run`. The refactor track is a side-track that pauses parity feature work to make subsequent feature work easier.

## Current measurements

These are the baselines the refactor track must not regress (`REGRESSION.md`). The CI gate now enforces them automatically on every PR — see "CI infrastructure" below.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Convergence failing | **33 / 212** |
| Convergence passing | **179 / 212** (84.4%) |
| Full suite failing | 56 / 696 |
| Full suite passing | 640 / 696 |
| Last verified | 2026-05-09 on `main` (post PR #35 merge, head `d9d8247`) |

## CI infrastructure (live)

Landed via [OSS-341](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-341) and unblocked via [OSS-342](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-342):

- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`** — runs on every PR to `main`. Steps: typecheck → full vitest → name-based regression check against `.ci/baseline.json`. Fails the PR if any baseline-passing test ID is now failing.
- **`.github/workflows/update-baseline.yml`** — runs on push to `main`. Regenerates `.ci/baseline.json` from a fresh test run; commits via `github-actions[bot]` with `[skip ci]` if the passing set changed.
- **Node version requirement: `>=22`** (encoded in `package.json` `engines.node`). `oxc-parser`'s `experimentalRawTransfer` throws on Node 20 — was the root cause of the apparent macOS/Linux divergence in OSS-342.
- **End-to-end smoke-tested** red-and-green via the throw-away PR #9 (closed unmerged): regression check correctly fails on intentional break, passes on revert.
- **Validated on real PRs**: every refactor-track PR through PR #35 has run the gate green — PR #10 (OSS-339), PR #11 (OSS-340), PR #12 (OSS-344), PR #13 (OSS-345), PR #14 (OSS-346), PR #17 (OSS-349 docs-only), PR #18 (OSS-350), PR #20 (OSS-351), PR #22 (OSS-353), PR #23 (OSS-354), PR #24 (OSS-355), PR #32 (OSS-356), PR #34 (OSS-357), PR #35 (OSS-358). Doc/planning-only PRs (PR #15 OSS-348, PR #16 REGRESSION, PR #19 + PR #21 + PR #25 + PR #27 + PR #29 + PR #31 + PR #33 STATE refreshes, PR #26 METHODOLOGIES post-merge routine, PR #28 BENCHMARKS.md bootstrap, PR #30 OSS-347 SPEC) also ran clean since they don't change source.

Helpful local commands:

- `pnpm typecheck` — runs `tsc --noEmit`
- `pnpm ci:baseline:check <vitest-json>` — local regression check against the stored baseline
- `pnpm ci:baseline:update <vitest-json>` — regenerate baseline locally (rare; auto-update on main is preferred)
- `node scripts/diff-platform-results.mjs <vitest-json>` — diff a vitest JSON against the baseline (cross-environment investigation tool)

## Branches in flight

| Branch | Head | Pushed | Tests | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | `d9d8247` (post PR #35 merge) | ✅ | baseline | **Refactor track v2 fully closed.** Track v1 + v2 + all doc/types/perf/process side-tracks shipped: predicates module, OPTIMIZER.md, REGRESSION.md mechanism, types.ts JSDoc, extract.ts JSX fold-in, closure-node threading, closure-form const literals, portable benchmark harness, post-merge cleanup routine, BENCHMARKS.md perf-history, OSS-347 SPEC + 34-line orchestrator. |
| `ast-parity/F2` | `a644c16` (stale) | ❌ local-only | parked | F2 cluster paused; will need rebase onto current `main` (refactor track v2 has fully closed since this branch was last touched — substantial foundation now available) before resuming |
| _(no active workstream branch)_ | — | — | — | Refactor track v2 closed. Next: parity work resumes (F2 cluster rebase or other CONVERGENCE_FAILURES.md feature) or OSS-352 backlog item or perf follow-ups (see "What to do next"). |

## Refactor track v2 ([OSS-343](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-343))

| Ticket | Title | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [OSS-343](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-343) | Refactor track v2 — segment generation cleanup *(parent)* | (no branch) | Backlog (auto-rolls up) |
| [OSS-344](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-344) | Consolidate `isStrippedSegment` + `isAnyComponentCtx` into `rewrite/predicates.ts` | `refactor/predicates-followup` (merged) | **Done** (PR #12) |
| [OSS-345](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-345) | Pre-compute field maps in `segment-generation.ts` | `refactor/precompute-field-maps` (merged) | **Done** (PR #13) |
| [OSS-346](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-346) | Refactor `generateSegmentCode` 8-phase sequencer | `refactor/generate-segment-code-phases` (merged) | **Done** (PR #14) |
| [OSS-347](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-347) | Discovery + plan for `generateAllSegmentModules` refactor *(planning — produced SPEC + 3 sub-tickets)* | `refactor/generate-all-segment-modules-spec` (merged) | **Done** (PR #30) |
| [OSS-356](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-356) | Sub-A — Extract `Prep` + inline-strategy from `generateAllSegmentModules` | `refactor/segment-gen-prep-inline` (merged) | **Done** (PR #32) |
| [OSS-357](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-357) | Sub-B — Extract migration-wiring + nested call-sites | `refactor/segment-gen-default-helpers` (merged) | **Done** (PR #34) |
| [OSS-358](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-358) | Sub-C — Extract `buildDefaultStrategySegment` sequencer; final orchestrator shape | `refactor/segment-gen-orchestrator-shape` (merged) | **Done** (PR #35) |

**Track v2 fully closed.** All seven sub-issues of OSS-343 are Done. The `generateAllSegmentModules` orchestrator at `src/optimizer/transform/segment-generation.ts` is now a 34-line sequencer over named helpers, down from 580 lines pre-refactor (~94% reduction). Per-PR commit messages followed the four-question format from `METHODOLOGIES.md` "Refactoring" section; Sub-A/B/C scope documented in `.planning/specs/segment-generation-refactor.md`.

## Refactor track v1 ([OSS-337](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-337)) — closed

All sub-issues merged and closed. Worth recording the shape because v2 follows the same playbook.

| Ticket | Outcome |
|---|---|
| OSS-338 | Extracted `MIG_REASON` const + `usingSegmentsOf` helper + named MIG-05a post-pass with JSDoc preconditions in `variable-migration.ts`. Renamed keys to action-prefixed style in a fixup commit. |
| OSS-339 | Named `OUTERMOST_BODY_THRESHOLD` magic constant + `formatWCall` helper + `spliceWithinBody` helper in `body-transforms.ts`. |
| OSS-340 | New module `rewrite/predicates.ts` consolidating `matchesRegCtxName` (3 byte-identical duplicates), `isEventHandlerOrJsxProp`, `hasUnderscorePlaceholderParams` across 4 files. |

## Parity feature status (refactor track v2 closed; parity work ready to resume)

Snapshot from before the refactor track started. Numeric features track the original `CONVERGENCE_FAILURES.md` grouping. Suffix letters (F1b, F1c) are sub-features that emerged from in-flight rescoping.

| Feature | Status | Test(s) | Brief |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 — `_ref` indirection | ✅ CLOSED | `component_level_self_referential_qrl` | shipped via PR #5; const-declarator fix added during review |
| F1b — mutual-recursion migration | OPEN | `example_self_referential_component_migration` | not started; deeper migration policy than F4 |
| F1c — inline-strategy emit ordering | LANDED (foundation only) | `root_level_self_referential_qrl_inline` | statement-order fix lives on `ast-parity/F2`; test won't flip until F2 also fixes path/hash/key-prefix bugs |
| F2 — hoisted / inline / lib strategies | PAUSED | 5–6 tests | active before refactor track started; resume on rebased `ast-parity/F2`. **The refactor track has now built foundation for F2:** named threshold, formatWCall, spliceWithinBody, predicates module. |
| F3 — `_rawProps` lightweight components | OPEN | 4 tests | 8 coordinated changes; bigger than original 1-pass scoping. Will reuse `isComponentCtx` + `isAnyComponentCtx` from OSS-344 once that lands. |
| F4 — MIG-05a shared destructure | LANDED partial | `example_invalid_references` | parent passes; segments still fail. OSS-338 cleaned the code path; nested-segment migration is the next step. |
| F5 — server-marker stripping → null body | OPEN | 3 tests |  |
| F6 — JSX runtime preservation | OPEN | 3 tests |  |
| F7 — inner-function extraction discipline | OPEN | 4 tests + `fun_with_scopes` from F8 |  |
| F8 — diverse semantic bugs | OPEN | 5 tests | each test needs its own fix |
| F9 — spread / var / const splitting | OPEN | 2 tests |  |
| F10 — import-aware naming | OPEN | 2 tests |  |

## Most recent meaningful progress

Most recent first. Trim entries older than ~10 to keep this file from bloating.

- **2026-05-09** — [OSS-358](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-358) (Sub-C of OSS-347) merged via PR #35. **Refactor track v2 fully closed.** Two units extracted: `buildDefaultStrategySegment(ext, ctx, prep, stripped, segmentKeyCounter) → { module, keyCounterValue }` folds the entire ~165-line default-strategy per-extraction body into one sequencer that calls Sub-A's shared rawProps helper + Sub-B's three helpers + the remaining inline logic; `generateAllSegmentModules` reshaped to a **34-line orchestrator** that forks `ctx.isInlineStrategy → buildInlineStrategySegment` vs default → `buildDefaultStrategySegment`. **Combined trajectory: 580 → 459 (Sub-A) → 214 (Sub-B) → 34 (Sub-C). ~94% reduction.** Convergence 179/212 + full-suite 640/696 + failure-families 1/1 — all unchanged from `main`. Open follow-up workstreams (out-of-scope for OSS-347, backlog candidates): eliminate per-iteration `ext` mutation; split the 28-field `SegmentGenerationContext` into logical groups.
- **2026-05-09** — [OSS-357](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-357) (Sub-B of OSS-347) merged via PR #34. Three units extracted from the default-strategy path: `buildNestedQrlDeclarations` (per-child noop-or-regular qrl declaration emit; `childQrlVarNames` flows through return value), `wireTopLevelMigration` (top-level-only ~115 lines of reexport auto-imports + move declaration inlining + capture filtering + capture/param reconciliation; mutation surface JSDoc'd), `buildNestedCallSites` (per-child JSX-attr-vs-call branching with event-prop transform, passive-event detection, loop-cross-capture detection, loop-local-param computation). **Orchestrator: 459 → 214 lines.** F4 (`example_invalid_references`) and MIG-05 (`should_keep_non_migrated_binding_from_shared_destructuring_declarator`) tests both green per baseline. Convergence + full-suite + failure-families unchanged.
- **2026-05-09** — [OSS-356](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-356) (Sub-A of OSS-347) merged via PR #32. Three units extracted from `generateAllSegmentModules` in `src/optimizer/transform/segment-generation.ts`: (1) `computeSegmentGenerationPrep` folds the 8 setup steps (extBySymbol, depth-sort, same-file symbol triple, segmentImportList, enumValueMap, fieldMaps) into one helper returning a typed `SegmentGenerationPrep` record; (2) `buildInlineStrategySegment` folds the inline-strategy raw-props consolidation + metadata-only TransformModule emit; (3) `consolidateRawPropsCaptures` shared helper deduplicates the raw-props partition between the inline-metadata path and the default-codegen path. Inline-metadata's two-pass form switched to one-pass (matching default-codegen) — output identical. **Orchestrator: 580 → 459 lines.** Convergence 179/212 + full-suite 640/696 + failure-families 1/1 — all unchanged from `main`.
- **2026-05-09** — [OSS-347](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-347) merged via PR #30 (discovery-only). New SPEC `.planning/specs/segment-generation-refactor.md` (~260 lines) documenting the 27-step phase decomposition of `generateAllSegmentModules` (`src/optimizer/transform/segment-generation.ts:244–824`, ~580 lines), five identified seams, and the proposed shape (orchestrator drops to ~80 lines after all sub-tickets land). Three sub-tickets filed in the same session: **[OSS-356](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-356)** (Sub-A — Prep + inline-strategy + shared `consolidateRawPropsCaptures`, ~1.5h, low blast), **[OSS-357](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-357)** (Sub-B — migration-wiring + nested call-sites + nested QRL decls, ~2–3h, medium blast — touches code with recent OSS-338/353/354 churn), **[OSS-358](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-358)** (Sub-C — `buildDefaultStrategySegment` sequencer + final orchestrator shape, ~1h, low blast). Sequencing is strict A → B → C. Open questions noted but explicitly out of scope: eliminating per-iteration `ext` mutation, splitting `SegmentGenerationContext`'s 28 fields. Convergence + full-suite baselines unchanged.
- **2026-05-09** — `BENCHMARKS.md` perf-history doc bootstrapped via PR #28 (no Linear ticket — small docs improvement). New file at repo root tracking BENCH-01 (full monorepo, ~1391 files) and BENCH-02 (worst-case `component.spec.tsx`, 3860 lines) wall-time vs the SWC reference. Bootstrapped with **9 historical data points** (2026-05-06 → 2026-05-09) captured by checking out each commit in an isolated `git worktree`, overlaying the current portable `optimizer-benchmark.test.ts` (older versions had hard-coded paths), running `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` per commit, and recording numbers. Includes "How to add a new data point" runbook, methodology caveats (5–15% variance, SWC-binding-rebuild caveat), and **two Mermaid `xychart-beta` ratio-over-time charts** (one per benchmark). Headline finding: the refactor track was not perf-targeted; ratios stay flat in the noise band (BENCH-01 2.66–2.86×, BENCH-02 4.65–5.27×) but the two most recent commits (post OSS-353 + OSS-354) sit at the low end — suggestive of a real ~5–7% improvement, barely above variance.
- **2026-05-09** — Post-merge cleanup routine codified via PR #26 (no Linear ticket — small docs improvement). New "After a PR merges" section in `METHODOLOGIES.md` between "Push / PR only when tests flip" and "Refactoring" captures the four-step routine: pull main + switch off, delete merged branch (local + remote, with `-d` / squash-merge guidance), verify Linear ticket Done, refresh STATE.md when state moves meaningfully. Includes a STATE.md-only **auto-merge carve-out** — pure-docs STATE.md PRs may be queued with `gh pr merge --auto --squash` and let CI gate them, no manual review required. Narrow "Don't" list keeps auto-merge scoped to STATE.md only.
- **2026-05-09** — [OSS-355](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-355) merged via PR #24. `tests/benchmark/optimizer-benchmark.test.ts` now portable: hard-coded `/Users/jackshelton/...` paths replaced with `$QWIK_HOME`-derived ones; `QWIK_SWC_BINDING` absolute-path env var replaced with a `QWIK_BINDING_MAP` napi-rs triple table (autodetects `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64-gnu`, `win32-x64-msvc`); `QWIK_SWC_BINDING_OVERRIDE` escape hatch added; skip messages differentiate missing `$QWIK_HOME` vs unsupported platform; unused `createRequire` import dropped. Also adds `.claude/rules/GENERAL.md` documenting the `$QWIK_HOME` convention. Verified locally on darwin-arm64 — both `BENCH-01` (full monorepo, 1391 files) and `BENCH-02` (worst-case file, 3860 lines) execute end-to-end. Both currently assertion-fail (2.75x / 4.83x respectively) — real perf gaps tracked separately. Convergence + full-suite baselines unchanged.
- **2026-05-09** — [OSS-354](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-354) merged via PR #23. `resolveConstLiterals` rewritten to operate directly on the closure AST node instead of re-parsing the body string. Companion change syncs the production-mode `s_<hash>` rename so const-literal inlining keys lookup against the post-rename symbolName. Convergence 33/212 + full-suite 56/696 unchanged.
- **2026-05-09** — [OSS-353](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-353) merged via PR #22. `extractSegments` gains optional `closureNodesOut?: Map<string, AstFunction>` 7th positional param; closure AST nodes are buffered during the walk and written into the out-map *after* `disambiguateExtractions` so post-rename `symbolName` keys match downstream lookups. `transform/index.ts` deletes the per-extraction body re-parse loop; `bodyScopeIds` derived directly from threaded closure nodes; `bodyPrograms` map removed. `diagnostics.ts` gains `classifyDeclarationTypeInClosure` (closure-body twin); `diagnostic-detection.ts` drops the `bodyPrograms` parameter and routes through the new helper. Side-effect: latent C02 diagnostic-position bug fixed (positions are now source-absolute) — 4 `ts-output/` snaps updated to reflect the corrected line/col. Convergence 33/212 + full-suite 56/696 unchanged.
- **2026-05-08** — [OSS-351](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-351) merged via PR #20. `extract.ts` folds the per-extraction `walk(arg, ...)` JSX-detection subtree walk into the main `walk(program, ...)`. Active-segment stack maintained on enter/leave of each extraction's wrapping node; per-segment `hasJsx` is flipped when an enclosed `JSXElement`/`JSXFragment` is visited; the file extension is finalised once at pop time via `extensionFromSegmentJsx`. `defaultExtension` hoisted to a per-call constant; `nodeContainedIn` defensive guard added; old `determineExtension` helper removed. Companion backlog item [OSS-352](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-352) filed during review for the pre-existing `inlinedQrl` path's lack of JSX detection (out-of-scope here). Convergence 33/212 + full-suite 56/696 unchanged. Also: [OSS-348](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-348) state cleanup — moved In Review → Done now that PR #15 has been merged for several commits.
## What to do next

**Refactor track v2 is fully closed.** All sub-issues of OSS-343 are Done. The `generateAllSegmentModules` orchestrator is a 34-line sequencer over six named helpers; the SPEC at `.planning/specs/segment-generation-refactor.md` documents the final shape. Convergence 33/212 + full-suite 56/696 baselines are unchanged from where they were when track v2 started — refactors were not perf-targeted, but `BENCHMARKS.md` shows they didn't regress either.

**Available work, no immediate active item:**

- **Parity work resumes** — F2 cluster (`ast-parity/F2`) is the largest available workstream. Branch is parked + stale; will need rebase onto current `main` (which has substantial new foundation: predicates module, named thresholds, helpers, immutable field maps, generateSegmentCode phase helpers, single-shared-AST plumbing, closure-node threading, closure-form resolveConstLiterals, the new orchestrator shape, and the CI gate). See `CONVERGENCE_FAILURES.md` for the 33 remaining convergence failures grouped by feature; F2/F3 are the largest, F4/F5/F6/F7/F8 are smaller and more independent.
- **OSS-352 backlog** — small standalone investigation: does the `inlinedQrl` extraction path need the same JSX-detection treatment OSS-351 added to the marker / JSX-attr paths? Pickable any time.
- **Perf follow-ups** — BENCH-01 monorepo ratio is **2.66×** vs the 1.15× cap, BENCH-02 worst-case is **4.67×** vs the 1.5× cap. File a Linear ticket per perf workstream; append a row to `BENCHMARKS.md` before/after each perf-targeted PR. The just-closed refactor track was *not* perf-targeted but did expose seams (named helpers, immutable Prep) that make profiling more tractable.
- **Two backlog candidates surfaced by OSS-347** — eliminate per-iteration `ext` mutation in segment-generation; split `SegmentGenerationContext`'s 28 fields into logical groups. Both are now easier with the orchestrator's named-helper shape. File when picked up.

**If you're between sessions and need to pick up cold:** read `OPTIMIZER.md` first (Two-namespaces section + Phase pipeline table + marker catalog), then `BENCHMARKS.md` for current perf state, then `CONVERGENCE_FAILURES.md` for the remaining parity work.

**Perf follow-ups remain available** when picked up after the refactor track closes: BENCH-01 monorepo ratio is **2.66×** vs the 1.15× cap, BENCH-02 worst-case is **4.67×** vs the 1.5× cap (see `BENCHMARKS.md`). File a Linear ticket per perf workstream rather than batching them — each one will need its own profiling pass. Append a row to `BENCHMARKS.md` before/after each perf-targeted PR so the impact is visible.

**Track v2 implementation is closed.** OSS-344, OSS-345, and OSS-346 all merged. Only [OSS-347](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-347) remains in the track and it is **discovery-only** — its output is a SPEC for refactoring `generateAllSegmentModules` plus follow-up implementation tickets, not direct code. When you start it: branch as `refactor/generate-all-segment-modules-spec`, refresh this STATE.md to mark OSS-347 In Progress, and read `OPTIMIZER.md`'s "Quick reference — code map" + the segment-generation deep dive for the orchestrator's current shape. Note that OSS-353 + OSS-354 have already shipped some of OSS-347's expected groundwork: closure AST nodes are now threaded through from `extractSegments`, and `resolveConstLiterals` operates directly on the closure node — both moves toward "one canonical AST walk per file."

**After OSS-347 produces its sub-tickets**, parity work resumes by rebasing `ast-parity/F2` onto current `main`. The F2 cluster bugs (path normalisation, hash, key prefix, extra empty segment file) will then have access to the foundation built by tracks v1+v2: predicates module, named thresholds, helpers, immutable field maps, named phase functions, single-shared-AST plumbing, closure-node threading, closure-form const-literal resolution, and a documented pipeline contract in `OPTIMIZER.md`.

**[OSS-352](https://linear.app/kunai/issue/OSS-352)** is a small standalone investigation backlog item (does the `inlinedQrl` extraction path need the same JSX-detection treatment OSS-351 added to the marker / JSX-attr paths?). It can be picked up at any time without disrupting OSS-347 or the F2 cluster.

**If you're between sessions and need to pick up cold:** read `OPTIMIZER.md` first — the Two-namespaces section + the Phase pipeline table + the marker catalog give you the working vocabulary. Then check Linear OSS-343 for the parent's roll-up status and OSS-347 for what's still open.

## Maintenance

**You are expected to update this file actively.** Not a passive snapshot — a working artifact.

### Branch scoping

Unlike other files in `.claude/rules/` (CONSTRAINTS, REGRESSION, METHODOLOGIES, CONVERGENCE_FAILURES, LINEAR, OPTIMIZER) which are project-wide rules edited and reviewed in isolation, **STATE.md is branch-scoped**. It reflects the active workstream of whatever branch it's committed on:

- **Edit/commit on feature & working branches only.** Never edit STATE.md directly on `main` as part of a standalone changeset. Never cherry-pick a STATE.md change to `main`.
- **It travels with merges.** When a feature branch merges into `main`, its STATE.md comes along naturally. After the merge, `main` carries that branch's final state until the next branch merges and overwrites it.
- **A branch without STATE.md is fine.** Branches that predate this convention or haven't started a workstream may not have one. Create one when meaningful work begins.
- **Refresh on new branches.** When branching off `main` for a new feature, the inherited STATE.md belongs to a different workstream. Update it to reflect the new branch's goal, branches-in-flight, feature focus, and progress log — don't carry over stale state from unrelated work.

In short: STATE.md is *authored* on feature branches, *propagates* through merges, and is *refreshed* (not deleted) on new branches.

### When to update

Update when:

- A test flips status (passing ↔ failing).
- A feature's status changes (OPEN → PARTIAL → CLOSED).
- A branch is created, merged, abandoned, or force-pushed.
- A Linear ticket's status changes (Backlog → In Progress → In Review → Done) for tickets the active workstream tracks.
- A feature description is materially corrected.
- A new substantial discovery refines scope.

Don't update for:

- Every commit (commit messages are the source of truth there).
- Mid-investigation debugging.
- Speculation about future features.

Each update:

1. Bump the "Last updated" date.
2. Add an entry at the top of "Most recent meaningful progress" with the date and a one-line summary.
3. Trim entries older than ~10 to keep this file from bloating.
4. Update the "Current measurements" table if test counts changed.
5. Update the "Branches in flight", "Refactor track v2", and "Parity feature status" tables if any changed.

## Where to look for more

- `OPTIMIZER.md` — end-to-end pipeline walkthrough with deep dives on capture analysis, migration policy, JSX rewrite, and segment metadata. Read this when onboarding into a new optimizer area.
- [`BENCHMARKS.md`](../../BENCHMARKS.md) (repo root) — perf-history doc tracking BENCH-01 / BENCH-02 wall-time vs the SWC reference, with two Mermaid charts and a runbook for adding new data points.
- `CONVERGENCE_FAILURES.md` — feature breakdown with per-test root causes
- `CONSTRAINTS.md` — hard rules (read-only directories)
- `REGRESSION.md` — regression invariants (now CI-enforced)
- `METHODOLOGIES.md` — process / workflow rules including the Refactoring section
- `LINEAR.md` — ticket management conventions including state UUIDs and auto-assignment
- `.github/workflows/README.md` — CI workflow documentation
- Linear OSS-343 — refactor track v2 parent (rolls up sub-issue completion)
- `pnpm vitest convergence --run` — current parity measurement
- `pnpm ci:baseline:check <vitest-json>` — local regression check against stored baseline
- `tests/optimizer/failure-families.test.ts` — secondary signal (broader, less strict than convergence)
