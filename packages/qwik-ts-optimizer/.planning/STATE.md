# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-10)

**Core value:** Runtime-identical output to SWC optimizer -- same segments, captures, hashes, QRL structure
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Test Infrastructure and Hash Verification

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Test Infrastructure and Hash Verification) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Hash verification must come FIRST -- if hashes don't match, nothing else can be validated
- [Roadmap]: Batch testing (10 snapshots at a time, lock, never regress) is the convergence strategy
- [Roadmap]: JSX/signals/events grouped into single phase since they are tightly coupled
- [Phase 01]: Segment vs parent module distinguished by metadata JSON presence, not ENTRY POINT marker
- [Phase 01]: SipHash-1-3 with zero keys confirmed byte-identical to Rust DefaultHasher for 389/401 corpus hashes; 7 edge cases deferred to optimizer phases

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- siphash npm package API needs verification against SipHash-1-3 variant with zero keys
- oxc-transform position stability needs verification (does TS stripping shift character positions?)
