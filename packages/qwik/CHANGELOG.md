# @builder.io/qwik

## 1.7.3

## 1.7.2

### Patch Changes

- Library builds now correctly generate \_fnSignal calls again. Any Qwik library that exports components should be built again. (by [@wmertens](https://github.com/wmertens) in [#6732](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/pull/6732))

- - built files are now under dist/ or lib/. All tools that respect package export maps should just work. (by [@wmertens](https://github.com/wmertens) in [#6715](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/pull/6715))
    If you have trouble with Typescript, ensure that you use `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` in your `tsconfig.json`.
  - `@builder.io/qwik` no longer depends on `undici`

- fix dev mode on windows (by [@Varixo](https://github.com/Varixo) in [#6713](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/pull/6713))
