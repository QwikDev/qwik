 * Low-level API for platform abstraction.
 *
 * Different platforms (browser, node, service workers) may have different ways of handling things
 * such as `requestAnimationFrame` and imports. To make Qwik platform-independent Qwik uses the
 * `CorePlatform` API to access the platform API.
 *
 * `CorePlatform` also is responsible for importing symbols. The import map is different on the
 * client (browser) then on the server. For this reason, the server has a manifest that is used to
 * map symbols to javascript chunks. The manifest is encapsulated in `CorePlatform`, for this
 * reason, the `CorePlatform` can't be global as there may be multiple applications running at
 * server concurrently.
 *
 * This is a low-level API and there should not be a need for you to access this.

   * Retrieve a symbol value from QRL.

   * references of resources that are needed. The QRLs contain all the information necessary to
   * retrieve the reference using `importSymbol`.
   *
   * Why not use `import()`? Because `import()` is relative to the current file, and the current
   * file is always the Qwik framework. So QRLs have additional information that allows them to
   * serialize imports relative to application base rather than the Qwik framework file.
   *
   * @param element - The element against which the `url` is resolved. Used to locate the container
   *   root and `q:base` attribute.
   * @param url - Relative URL retrieved from the attribute that needs to be resolved against the
   *   container `q:base` attribute.
   * @param symbol - The name of the symbol to import.
   * @returns A promise that resolves to the imported symbol.
