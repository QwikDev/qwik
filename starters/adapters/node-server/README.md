## Node Server

This app has a minimal zero-dependencies server. Using the built-in `http.createServer` API.
This should be faster and less overhead than Express or other frameworks.

After running a full build, you can preview the build using the command:

```
npm run serve
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3004/](http://localhost:3004/)
