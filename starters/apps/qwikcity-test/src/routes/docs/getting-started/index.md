# Getting Started

## Creating an app using the CLI

The first step is to create an application. Qwik comes with a CLI that allows you to create a basic working skeleton of an application. We will use the CLI to create a Todo sample app, and we will use that application to do a walk-through of Qwik so that you can familiarize yourself with it.

## Running in development

Once the application is download.

1. Change into the directory created by the `npm create qwik@latest`.

```shell
cd qwik-todo
```

2. Install NPM modules:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Invoke the dev server

```shell
npm start
```

4. You should see a server running with your To-do application

```shell
  vite v2.8.6 dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 157ms.
```

5. Visit http://localhost:3000/ to explore the To-do app.
